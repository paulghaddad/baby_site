One of the best parts of being a parent is how much there is to learn! I’m learning from Hayden each day. And I’m constantly learning how to be a better parent, which covers a variety of topics including: child development, learning, food, and family. 

Below are a few books I’ve found helpful along the way. 

I’m always looking for a good book. If you have a recommendation, send me an email: amy@amymhaddad.com.
