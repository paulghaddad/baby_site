## Activities 3-4 Months

## 1. Breakfast with mommy (or daddy)

![breakfast with mommy](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.00.34-pm.png)

After I fed Hayden in the morning, he’d join me at the kitchen table where I’d have my breakfast. “Breakfast with mommy,” as I later called it, turned into a fun daily ritual with a lot of benefits. 

Hayden would sit in his [BabyBjörn bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Cotton/dp/B00BQYVOKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2NUUQWVU6ML1B&keywords=bjorn+baby+bouncer&qid=1663166078&s=home-garden&sprefix=bajorn+baby+bouncer%2Cgarden%2C85&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTk4xQ1ZZRExQRUw5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzY3NjU2MUg2TzZNVUFBMUxXMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTA3MzE4MVNSMUszTVI1SUNGTyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), which was placed near the kitchen table, as I showed -- **and involved** -- him in the breakfast preparation.

I’d open the bag of frozen blueberries and bring them over to him to let him take a look.  

Then, I’d go over to the kitchen cupboard and pull out a bowl. I’d bring it over to him and let him explore it with me. He loved to touch it, as I’d **talk about the color, texture, and weight**. I’d do the same thing with a spoon, placemat, and napkin, along with any other breakfast items. 

**The process mesmerized him**. 

He’d watch carefully as I’d pour some cereal into a bowl and sprinkle a few berries on top. I’d kneel down to his level so he could see and hear me pour orange juice into my glass.

Once breakfast was made, I’d sit at the table and talk with Hayden as I ate. 

I’d ask him a question and then pause as I’d take a bite and wait for him to respond with a coo, grunt, or squeal. 

This would go on until I finished whatever I was eating. Then, we’d go play. The entire process only took 10 to 15 minutes, but the benefits were many:

* **Explore real world kitchen objects and put them to use in a real way**. A bowl, for example, isn’t just another thing in the world; we can use it to hold food. 
* **Model eating and table manners** -- skills that’ll pay dividends when baby begins eating in the near future.  
* **Teach conversational skills**. Ask a question. Pause, and let baby respond, while you take a bite. 

Above all, “breakfast with mommy” is a way to teach patience. 

At first, Haden would only last a few minutes in his bouncer. He was anxious to get up and play. But over time his patience grew, and so did his intrigue with the entire breakfast process, both preparation and cleanup.

## 2. Grab or kick it 

![play gym](/img/img_8749.jpeg)

**Make grasping objects fun for baby**.

I took some of Hayden's favorite rattles and teethers and hung them from his play gym with [red ribbon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091GNB79S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). That way, they were low enough so he could grab them with his hands and put them in his mouth. 

This setup was also a great way to get him using his feet. 

The objects were low enough for him to kick, which he loved to do! I liked the [Baby Bear Wooden Rattle Shaker](https://www.bellalunatoys.com/collections/waldorf-baby-toys-0-12-months/products/green-tones-baby-bear-shaker) for this reason. It was a wide enough target for baby.

**Also consider handing baby an object to explore while he sits in a [baby bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Cotton/dp/B00BQYVOKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2NUUQWVU6ML1B&keywords=bjorn+baby+bouncer&qid=1663166078&s=home-garden&sprefix=bajorn+baby+bouncer%2Cgarden%2C85&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTk4xQ1ZZRExQRUw5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzY3NjU2MUg2TzZNVUFBMUxXMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTA3MzE4MVNSMUszTVI1SUNGTyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)**. This gives him a different angle to grab objects.

## 3. The many uses of mobiles

![baby with mobile](/img/img_8755.jpeg)

Mobiles can have new uses during these months. 

Sure, you can **hang a mobile overhead** for baby. But that’s just the start. 

**Get baby kicking** by laying baby on their back on their playmat. Then, dangle a mobile just above their feet.  

You can also **use a mobile during tummy time**. 

Get baby on his tummy, then dangle the mobile in front of him or to the side. Hayden loved this! It gave him a new perspective, as well as the motivation he needed to lift that heavy head.

#### Suggested Item:

## 4. **More tummy time fun!**

![Tummy time](/img/img_8850.jpeg)

Use props to make tummy time fun!

**Babies love looking at other babies**. That’s why I’d open up a board book about baby faces, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and propped it up in front of Hayden. He loved this! I’d turn the pages periodically to keep things interesting.

![Tummy time with mirror](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.23.30-pm.png)

**Mirrors are also a lot of fun for babies**. They love to look at themselves! So place baby on his tummy and prop up a mirror in front of him. 

I also found it useful to **prop up pictures of artwork or baby animals** for him to look at during tummy time. I got these pictures from daily calendars ([Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2) and [Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)). I’d select a few pictures and place them in front of him, which he absolutely loved.

**Mobiles were another favorite** tummy time item. 

Get baby on his belly, then dangle the mobile in front of baby or to the side. Babies love mobiles, and provide the motivation to lift that heavy head!

![Tummy time with toys](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-8.59.15-pm.png)

And you can **always put an enticing toy in front of baby** while he’s on his tummy.

## 5. Sit up and explore

![Baby sitting up looking at toys](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-8.56.36-pm.png)

Although sitting up is hard work for baby, you can make it fun and interesting! 

I’d **sit on the floor** with Hayden sitting in front of me. Then, we’d explore objects together, like a ball, teether, or rattle. If he dropped the object, then I’d help him lean over to pick it up. 

Other times, I’d place an object to the side or in front of him and he’d practice picking it up himself. 

**Dangling an object in front of baby** while they’re sitting is another way to grab and explore an object. Plus, it gives baby another perspective of the object.

**Sensory books** are great to use with baby while sitting. I’d open up a page in a book and Hayden would lean forward to touch and explore.

## 6. Chef baby

![Produce](/img/img_9252.jpeg)

As fun as it is to explore toys with baby, it’s equally fun to **explore real world objects**. 

Kitchen exploration was one of my favorite things to do with Hayden around this age.

I’d wash some fruits and veggies, such as an apple, carrot, potato, lime, and bell pepper, in advance and put them in a colander. I’d try to select a variety of colors, shapes, and textures. 

At the kitchen table, I’d sit with Hayden on my lap and we’d explore the **colander of produce together** -- talking about and touching each one.

![Kitchen utensils](/img/img_9253.jpeg)

I also did this with kitchen objects. I’d select a few items, like a spoon, whisk, and spatula, in advance and place them on the table. Then, we’d touch, hold, and talk about each one. 

#### **Suggested items**:

Ice cream scoop

Whisk

Spatula

Spoon

Colander

Measuring cups

## 7. Make time for mirror time

![ Baby looking into mirror](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.23.30-pm.png)

Babies love looking at themselves in the mirror! 

Let me share my favorite way to incorporate mirror time. 

**I’d lay side-by-side next to Hayden on his play mat, holding a mirror above us. He loved looking up and studying his face**. Then, I’d turn the mirror to the side so he could see my face -- another face to study! 

I’d point out parts of our faces: “mommy’s nose”; “Hayden’s nose.” This could go on for some time. 

**A mirror is also great to use during tummy time**. Prop a mirror up so baby can study his face while on his belly. He’ll love it!

## 8. Bubble time!

![Bubbles](/img/drew-beamer-hk6e4uxjmgo-unsplash.jpg)

Bubbles are such a thrill for baby!  

Since they’re such a hit, I keep bubbles easily accessible: in the car, stroller, garage, and back porch. I like [Bubble Tree’s bubbles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CMM2YYZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) because they come in a pack of four, are non-toxic, and the bubble solution is in an aluminum bottle.

#### **Suggested item**:

## 9. Get those hands moving

![Hands](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-9.23.16-pm.png)

Want to get baby some practice using their hands? Give these ideas a try.

**Put a cloth, like a washcloth, on baby’s foot**, and he’ll work hard to pull it off. Once he’s mastered this, you **do the same game with a small oven mitt**: stick the mitt on his foot and baby will pull it off. 

You can **play similar games using baby’s hands**. Put a cloth on baby’s hand, and he’ll pull it off. Then, try a sock or a small oven mitt.

#### **Suggested Items**:

Washcloth

Small oven mit

## 10. Aren’t baby animals cute?!

![Baby animal](/img/adam-mosley-4sepxkg8xzw-unsplash.jpg)

Expose your baby to our beautiful world! 

I purchased a few calendars of artwork, baby animals, and beautiful places:

* [Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2) 
* [National Parks 2022 Box Calendar ](https://www.amazon.com/National-Parks-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549221183/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3LNZYRSIY2HBK&keywords=National+Parks+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978888&sprefix=national+parks+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-3)
* [Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar ](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)

Then, I’d tear off a few pages from a calendar, lay on my back next to Hayden, and we’d look at some beautiful places, animals, and artwork and “talk”about them. 

I’d point out what I saw and ask him questions. Then, I’d pause to see what he had to say.

We’ve been doing this for months and love it! It’s especially fun now that he’s older and babbles responses back to my comments and questions.

## 11. **Fun with books**

This 3 to 4 month age is also when sensory books became a big hit with Hayden. 

I found that sitting on the floor was the best way to engage with these books at this age.

So he’d be in the sitting position, and I’d sit behind him for support. I’d put a sensory book on his legs or on the floor in front of him. Then, he’d lean forward to touch the book.

Outside of sensory books, we did lots of reading while laying on our backs, side-by-side, on his playmat. I found this position more comfortable, and far less to juggle.

#### **Suggested books**:

Farm by Tiger Tales

Big Red Barn by Margaret Wise Brown

A Picnic with Monet by Julie Merberg

In the Garden with Van Gogh by Julie Merberg

In the Garden with Van Gogh by Julie Merberg

My First I See You: A Mirror Book by Eric Carle

## 12. It’s laundry time

![Laundry](/img/annie-spratt-5tfci4nj6b4-unsplash.jpg)

**It seems mundane, but folding laundry can be fun and educational**.

I’d have Hayden “help” me fold a basket of laundry. I’d pull out a towel, for example, and have him touch, hold, and explore it. 

Then, we’d “talk” about it. 

I’d describe the texture and color. I’d also explain when and why we use kitchen towels, for example.

I’d continue the same process with shirts, pants, socks, and anything else that was in the laundry basket.

To break it up, I’d often **incorporate a game of peek-a-boo**. I’d put a small towel over his face or mine, and he’d pull it off. This would result in giggles, lots of giggles.

## 13. Sing and Dance

![Record player](/img/adrian-korte-5gn2soeac40-unsplash.jpg)

**Turn on some beautiful music and listen for a few minutes**. I like to expose my baby to a range of music, and we talk about it. “Do you hear the drums?” Or “I hear a piano and flute.”

We also liked to “dance.” I’d hold Hayden and we’d just sway to the beat. 

**Baby loves the sound of your voice**. He’ll give you lots of smiles as you sing the words to even the most basic of songs. 

These are some of the songs Hayden loved at this age:

* It’s a Small World
* Old McDonald
* The More We Sing Together 
* Mr. Golden Sun

#### **Suggested item:**

## 14. E﻿xplore Nature

![Tree](/img/niko-photos-tgtvxeor_rs-unsplash.jpg)

Make time for nature. **Simply stand in front of a window and look outside, and talk about what you see.** 

On more than one occasion, I’d hold Hayden in front of a window studying a bug attached to the screen from outside. He’d be transfixed. 

Better yet, **step outside and see -- and experience -- nature first hand**. I liked to hold my baby and walk around our backyard, narrating what I saw and heard, as he took in this different environment. 

Point out the sights and sounds you’re experiencing. For example, “I hear the birds chirping.” Or “do you feel the breeze?!” 

You can also introduce elements of nature: pull off a leaf from a tree or pick a flower, show it to him, and have him touch it.
