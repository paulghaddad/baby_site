## Activities 7-8 Months

## 1. Basketball for babies

![activities for babies - basketball ](/img/activities-for-babies-basketball-1.jpeg)

Hayden loved his [object permanence box](https://amzn.to/3Dek3n1), where he’d drop a ball in the circular hole and it’d roll back out to him.\
\
**So I iterated on it and created a little basketball hoop**.

![activities for babies - playing basketball ](/img/activities-for-babies-basketball-2.jpeg)

\
I took an empty box of grape tomatoes and cut the bottom out of it. Then I attached it to the edge of a plastic storage bin using painters tape. The bin was just the right height for Hayden to reach up with his arm with a ball, while on his belly, and “dunk.” 

![activities for babies - happy baby playing basketball](/img/activities-for-babies-basketball-3.jpeg)

**He loved dropping the ball**, or a block or any other toy, through the small box as you can tell in the above picture. This was also **a fun activity to do while sitting up**. He’d pick up toy after toy and drop it through the box.

#### Suggested Items:

Small ball 

Small empty box (I used a small cardboard box that held grape tomatoes)

[Plastic storage bin](https://www.containerstore.com/s/clear-weathertight-totes/d?productId=10026213)

[Painter’s tape](https://amzn.to/3TLfBTY)

## 2﻿. Go on a scavenger hunt

![Activities for babies - go on a scavenger hunt](/img/activities-for-babies-scavenger-hunt.jpeg)

I brought Hayden into his playroom and he knew something was amiss. I’d put several toys under his play quilt. His aim was to find the hidden items.

**He loved the challenge**, and his reward: mouthing each item he found!

I found it useful to put a few larger items, like a patchwork ball, near the edge of the quilt to give Hayden a hint that there are items under his play quilt.

#### Suggested Items:

Play quilt (a large towel or blanket could work, too)

A variety of toys

## 3. Fun with shadows

![Activities for babies - using a flashlight during playtime](/img/activities-for-babies-flashlight.jpg)

Hurricane Ian came sweeping through Florida and knocked out our power for a few days. I had ample time to use a flashlight with Hayden. And he loved it!\
\
One experience stands out. 

We were sitting in our living room when **I took a flashlight and moved the light around the room**. Hayden’s eyes followed. Then, I shined light on various objects in the room -- including my toes. He ate it up!

Then came the **hand puppets**.\
\
I shined the light on the wall and my husband made hand puppets. Hayden’s eyes bounced from the wall to my husband’s hand -- trying to make the connection. 

Something unexpected happened next. 

Hayden took this large rattle and held it up in the air. He then moved his arm up and down. He was watching the wall the entire time, **seeing the shadow of the rattle move**. He was mesmerized!

I’ve since used a flashlight during playtime on many other occasions, and the reaction is the same. It hasn’t gotten old. 

**Hayden also loves to see the light come in through the window in the mornings**. It stirs up his curiosity. 

![](/img/activities-for-babies-shadows-2.jpeg)

It’s fun to **sing songs that involve hand motions**, like “Where is Thumbkin?,” as I’m doing in the picture above. Hayden loved seeing the shadows.

You can also make **hand puppets**. Or hold an object in the air so baby can see its shadow.  

#### Suggested Items:

[Flashlight](https://amzn.to/3TGtXEU)

## 4. Experiment with rolled oats

![Activities for babies - playing with rolled oats](/img/activities-for-babies-oats.jpeg)

\
Pour some [rolled oats](https://amzn.to/3fgkJQH) into a bowl and sit with baby on the floor to explore them. This is one of Hayden’s favorite activities!

He loves the texture. He runs his fingers through the oats -- over and over and over again.\
\
Iterate on this activity by having a second bowl filled with water. Leave it next to the dry oats. Once baby has had enough of the rolled oats, you can mix some water to give the oats a different texture.\
\
You can add yet another texture to this activity by blending some rolled oats into a powder consistency in advance.

![Activities for babies - playing with rolled oats](/img/activities-for-babies-oats_2.jpeg)

The older Hayden got, the messier this activity became. So I recommend putting the oats in a bowl, and placing it in a plastic bin to contain the mess. You can also put a sheet on the floor in case oats go flying!

#### Suggested Items:

[Rolled oats](https://amzn.to/3fgkJQH)

Large bowl

## 5. **Raid the Pantry**

![Activities for babies - explore pantry items](/img/activities-for-babies-pantry-items.jpeg)

Hayden loves everything related to the kitchen. So one day I took a small plastic bin and filled it with items from our pantry: a bag of beans, protein bar, tomato paste, bottle of water, and a bag of rice, among other items. 

![Activities for babies - items from pantry](/img/activities-for-babies-pantry-items-2.jpeg)

**I intentionally chose items of different shapes, textures, colors, and weights**. Some, like the bag of rice, were heavy and required two hands to be lifted out of the bin. I also picked **some that made noise** when shaken (like the bag of dried beans).  

Then, we sat on the floor in the kitchen to explore them. Like all of our kitchen explorations, this was such a hit!

#### Suggested Items:

Small plastic bin or a large bowl

Items from your pantry

## 6. Ice cubes on cookie sheet

![activities for babies - touching ice](/img/activities-for-babies-ice-cubes-1.jpeg)

Put some ice cubes on a cookie sheet or pan and let baby explore. It’s so simple, but so fascinating to baby!

Hayden was hesitant at first with the cold sensation from the ice cubes. Then he got really into it, and loved moving the cubes across the pan because they moved so easily!

![activities for babies - make it glide](/img/activities-for-babies-touching-ice-cube.jpeg)

**This activity is great for hand-eye coordination**. The cubes glide quickly across the pan, which makes them hard to grab and pick up.

![activities for babies - holding ice cube](/img/activities-for-babies-holding-ice-cube.jpeg)

I made my own ice cubes by freezing water in a [freezer tray](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T6ZG9AA?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=learningbabie-20&linkId=a954816a189bde1f12d179e2842703da&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) that I used to hold pureed foods. I found these cubes to be a good size for Hayden to hold and maneuver. 

#### Suggested Items:

Ice cubes

Cookie sheet

## 7. Laundry basket fun

![Activities for babies - sitting in a laundry basket ](/img/activities-for-babies-laundry-basket-fun-1-.jpeg)

Laundry baskets are loads of fun for baby! Here’s a simple idea to try.

Fill a basket with some of baby’s favorite toys. Then, place baby inside of the basket so he’s in the sitting position and can explore. 

Hayden loved this!

He ran his fingers along the cutouts of the basket sides. He also seemed to enjoy exploring his toys in a new context. And he delighted in picking up a toy and dropping it over the edge. 

![Activities for babies - laundry basket with string](/img/activities-for-babies-laundry-basket-with-string.jpeg)

Once the novelty wears off, try this challenge: take some rope and lace it back and forth through the holes on the sides of the laundry basket. Do this until about three-fourths of the basket is laced up. Leave enough space for baby to get into the basket. Then, add some desirable toys or objects.

Now place baby inside of the basket and let him explore!

Hayden loves all things kitchen. So I placed kitchen objects -- spatula, oven mitt, measuring cups, and whisk (his favorite) -- in the basket. 

The rope made it difficult for him to get these things. Using familiar toys or objects in a new context will get baby thinking. It’ll also give baby some good problem-solving practice, as he navigates objects through the rope. 

Another idea to try is to lay a laundry basket on its side, place it against the wall, and fill it with some toys. Then, baby will delight in getting the toys out. 

#### Suggested items:

Laundry basket

Baby’s favorite toys 

[Rope](https://amzn.to/3TJIcc0)

## 8. **Can you knock it down?**

![activities for babies - knock it down baby](/img/baby_activities_laundry_basket_cover.jpeg)

Turn a laundry basket upside down and place a favorite toy or two on top. Baby will see the toy, and think to himself: “how do I get this thing down?!” 

I’m sure that’s what Hayden was thinking the first time I did this activity with him. He stared at his ball placed on top of the basket for what seemed like an eternity: thinking, thinking, thinking. 

![](/img/baby_activities_laundry_basket2.jpeg)

He’s since learned to get the toys in different ways, which is why this simple activity is a great one: it’ll **give baby some problem-solving practice**. 

![](/img/baby_activities_laundry_basket1.jpeg)

For an extra challenge, stack a few empty boxes or plastic containers (like a yogurt container) on top of the laundry basket with a toy on top. 

#### Suggested Items:

Laundry basket

Small empty box or plastic container

## 9. Tip it over and pour it out

Put the laundry basket upright and fill it with a handful of toys. Baby will figure out how to tip over the basket to get the toys out. 

![activities for babies - get items from laundry basket](/img/activities-for-babies-get-items-from-laundry-basket.jpeg)

Now that the basket is on its side, baby will have to figure out how to reach in and grab the toys. 

#### Suggested items:

Laundry basket

Baby’s favorite toys 

## 10. Sink vs float water activity for baby

![activities for babies - sink vs float](/img/activities-for-babies-sink-vs-float.jpeg)

Water time outside of bath time is so much fun for baby!\
\
I took a rectangular shaped storage bin, filled it with water, and placed a bunch of toys in it. I used this type of bin because the sides were short so Hayden could easily reach into the water. It also provided plenty of space for him to explore. But I’ve also done this activity with small bins. So use what you have!\
\
Some toys sank. Some floated. In part that’s what this activity is all about: learning that some items sink and others float. Baby will also see that familiar objects move differently in water: they’re harder to pick up.

Measuring cups are one of my favorite water time objects to use with Hayden. It’s fun to help him fill a cup with water. Then, pour it out like a waterfall: hear the water, see the splash, put baby’s arm underneath and feel it. 

So much fun -- for mommy and baby!

#### Suggested items:

Storage bin or small basin

Water-proof toys, teethers, or balls

Measuring cups

## 11. Warm vs cold: ice cubes in warm water 

![activities for babies - ice cubes in warm water](/img/activities-for-babies-ice-cubes.jpeg)

Help baby learn about warm versus cold with this simple activity.\
\
Start with two small containers or bowls. Fill one with warm water. Fill the other with ice cubes. I made my own ice cubes by freezing water in a baby [ice cube tray](https://amzn.to/3DEMgoE) that I used to hold pureed foods. I found these cubes to be a good size for Hayden to hold and maneuver. 

Let baby touch the contents in each container.

![activities for babies - holding ice cubes](/img/activities-for-babies-ice-cubes-2.jpeg)

\
Then, help baby pick up an ice cube and plop it into the warm water. Have him touch the dissolving ice cube, and feel the changing temperature of the water.

![activities for babies - playing with ice](/img/activities-for-babies-playing-with-ice.jpeg)

I’ve also done this activity by adding a third container: one filled with cool water. Feel the temperature gradations (warm, cool, cold). See what happens when baby drops ice cubes into cool water compared to warm water. 

#### Suggested items:

2 small containers or bowls

Ice cubes

[Baby food ice cube tray](https://amzn.to/3DEMgoE)

## 12. **Bake me a cake!**

![](/img/activities-for-babies-make-a-cake.jpeg)

This is such a fun age to bake with baby! Hayden loves all things related to the kitchen -- even baking, even though baked goods aren’t part of his diet yet.

Apple spice cake is one of our favorite recipes. **He loves being part of the process**. 

![activities for babies - baking with baby](/img/activities-for-babies-bake-me-a-cake-2.jpeg)

He'll smell each ingredient and touch each utensil (the measuring cups and whisk continue to be his favorites!).

He’ll also help me along the way. I’ll fill the measuring cup with flour, for example, and he’ll help me pour it into the bowl. 

After all of the ingredients are together, he’ll help me mix everything together. He’ll hold the whisk and I’ll put my hand on top of his. Round and round and round we go until the batter is smooth. 

![activities for babies - cooking with mommy](/img/cooking.jpeg)

It’s so much fun for him (and me!). But it’s also **teaches him useful things**, like hand-eye coordination and hand dexterity.

#### Suggested items:

Simple recipes and a dose of patience!

## 13. Let’s make lemon soup

![activities for babies - make lemon soup ](/img/activities-for-babies-make-lemon-soup-1-.jpeg)

This activity combines two things Hayden loves: water and kitchen supplies. 

In advance, I set out a towel on the floor (in anticipation of water going everywhere!) with some kitchen supplies on top: measuring cups, spatula, whisk, pot, and a colander of lemons. 

I chose lemons because they’re easy for babies to hold and explore. Limes are another idea to try. 

![activities for babies - grab lemons from colander ](/img/activities-for-babies-make-lemon-soup-12.jpeg)

First we explored the colander of lemons: picking up the lemons, touching them, holding them, counting them. 

Then, we dropped each one into the water (splash!) and stirred them around in the pot. 

Fish out the lemons with the measuring cups and do it again to baby’s delight!

#### Suggested items:

Measuring cups

Spatula

Whisk

Pot

Colander of lemons 

## 14. Crawling through tunnels

![activities for babies - crawl through a tunnel](/img/activities-for-babies-crawl-through-a-tunnel.jpeg)

I brought Hayden into his playroom and he immediately noticed some changes. 

I came in earlier and made a tunnel: two plastic bins with a blanket on top. I used some painters tape to secure the blanket to the bins.

At first he wasn’t sure what to do. So I rolled a ball through the tunnel. He loved going through it and looking behind to make sure I was still there. He soon got the idea and began traversing around the bins and through the tunnel repeatedly.\
\
Then the real fun began. 

![activities for babies - crawl through a tunnel and play peek-a-boo](/img/activities-for-babies-crawl-through-a-tunnel-2.jpeg)

**Peek-a-boo is a riot with a tunnel**! I hid behind one of the plastic containers while Hayden was in the tunnel. He came out of the tunnel to find me and I stayed hidden. Soon enough I popped my head around the corner and many giggles ensued. And so began a long game of peek-a-boo.

![activities for babies - crawl through a tunnel with pull toy](/img/activities-for-babies-crawl-through-a-tunnel-4.jpeg)

Later, I took out Hayden’s **pull toy**. I pulled it around the plastic bins and through the tunnel, and Hayden chased it with enthusiasm written all over his face!

![activities for babies - crawl through a tunnel ](/img/activities-for-babies-crawl-through-a-tunnel-3.jpeg)

\
I think he liked **moving through space in a different way**. I also think he enjoyed **seeing his toys in a new context**. 

If you think one tunnel is fun. Then you should add a second one. And if you’re running out of plastic bins, then simply lean a laundry basket against the wall; drape a baby blanket over the basket for dramatic effect.

#### Suggested Items:

Plastic bins or laundry baskets

Baby blankets

Toys

## 15. Create an obstacle course

![activities for babies - crawling challenge through blankets](/img/activities-for-babies-crawling-challenge-through-blankets.jpeg)

Choose a variety of blankets, towels, quilts, and even a bedsheet that contain different shapes, colors, and textures. Then, spread them across the floor. But don’t lay them flat; ensure that there are plenty of lumps and bumps. Spread a handful of toys throughout.

![activities for babies - crawling challenge through blankets to knock down tower](/img/activities-for-babies-crawling-challenge-through-blankets-2.jpeg)

**Baby will love the challenge of traversing new terrain** he has to crawl over to get the toys.

#### Suggested Items:

An assortment of blankets, quilts, towels and even a bedsheet and an assortment of baby’s favorite toys

## 16. It’s a race!

Hayden loves everything to do with a ball -- a multicolored patchwork ball in particular. He also likes to compete.\
\
So we “race.” 

At first, I’d roll the ball, then we both chase after it. Eventually, he figured out how to roll the ball and took over this role.This is a great game to get baby to move as he’s learning to crawl.

## 17. Ball grab

![activities for babies - ball drop in water](/img/activities-for-babies-ball-drop-in-water.jpeg)

This ball grab activity is not only fun (after all, water is involved!). But it’s also great for hand-eye coordination. 

Fill a small basin with [plastic balls](https://amzn.to/3gOy8A4). Sit down with baby and he’ll try to grab them. The challenge is that these balls are slick in the water and move fast.

![activities for babies - pick up ball in water](/img/activities-for-babies-ball-drop-in-water-2.jpeg)

\
\
Hayden loved to pick up a ball, lay it on the towel, then drop the ball back into the basin of water -- splash! **See the ball drop, hear it drop into the water, feel the water splash as a result**.

Dropping a single ball was so much fun for Hayden that I took several balls and dropped them into the water all at once. He loved it!\
\
Tip: put towel under basin of water. 

#### Suggested Items:

[Plastic balls](https://amzn.to/3gOy8A4)

Small basin or storage container

## 18. Play with goo 

![activities for babies - playing with goo](/img/activities-for-babies-playing-with-goo.jpeg)

This two-ingredient recipe -- [cornstarch](https://amzn.to/3U4hxXa) and water -- resulted in a ton of fun for baby and mommy! Plus, the set up is minimal: drizzle some water into a bowl of cornstarch.\
\
I put about two cups of cornstarch into a small bowl. Then, I slowly add water until the cornstarch becomes liquid.

The first time we did this activity Hayden dug right in and took handfuls of the mixture. Once he had a fist full of it, however, he seemed unsure of the texture and tried to wipe his hand clean on his shorts. 

This goo has different textures. And if you haven’t tried it, you should!

Once you add the water, the mixture becomes a liquid. Then, it gets clumpy. And then it turns into a solid. The goo that hit the sheet hardened and looked like a Jackson Pollock painting. 

![activities for babies - playing with goo again](/img/activities-for-babies-playing-with-goo-3.jpeg)

As he explored, goo got on his clothes, arms and legs. He loved it! So I got in on the act and took a fist full of goo and drizzled some on his hands. This resulted in a ton of smiles!

I admit, this activity can get messy. That’s why I recommend putting a sheet down underneath the materials to contain the mess. Then, drop the sheet into the wash after the activity is done (and stick baby in the bath!).

#### Suggested Items:

[Cornstarch](https://amzn.to/3U4hxXa) 

Small mixing bowl

Bedsheet 

Water

## 19. Explore a cabinet

![activities for babies - explore kitchen cabinet](/img/activities-for-babies-explore-kitchen-cabinet.jpeg)

Set aside some items in a kitchen or  bathroom cabinet and give baby an opportunity to explore them. He’ll love it!

I cleared out a cabinet in the kitchen and in the bathroom and filled each one with baby safe items. Extra space can be hard to find. So if you can’t devote an entire cabinet to baby, try making a cabinet “baby safe” just for this activity. Then, you can restore its usual contents. 

In the kitchen, I’ll add a few mixing bowls, baby spoons, empty plastic containers, and various kitchen supplies (like a whisk or measuring cups). In the bathroom, I have items like washcloths, unused toothbrushes, and loofahs. This activity is such a winner, so I update the items each time we do it. 

![activities for babies - explore kitchen cabinet and how things work](/img/activities-for-babies-explore-kitchen-cabinet-2.jpeg)

Hayden loves taking all of the items out, exploring one item at a time. Then, we put them back. And he takes them all out again. The process continues for some time. He also loves exploring the hinges to see how the cabinet works.

**I involve him in every step of the activity.** When we enter the bathroom, for example, he helps me turn on the light. We sit on the bathroom floor and he opens the cabinet to explore. At the end of the activity, he closes the cabinet door and helps me turn off the light. 

#### Suggested Items:

Kitchen cabinet: oven mitt, empty plastic food containers, baby spoon, mixing bowls, spatula, whisk

Bathroom cabinet: loofahs, washcloths, unused toothbrushes, floss, hair brush

## 20. Bathroom tour

![activities for babies - bathroom tour](/img/activities-for-babies-bathroom-tour.jpeg)

Hayden loves tours of our home. We’ll open the closet doors and take a peak in his closet, or mine. We’ll talk and touch the items we see.\
\
We’ll also take a stop in the bathroom -- a room that catches his fascination. After he helps me turn on the light, we head to the bathroom sink to explore. 

I place him on the counter and turn on the water. He enjoys watching the water rush down the drain. I help him extend his arm and sprinkle some water on it. 

Then, I fill the sink with water. I let the water sit for a few seconds then drain it. He’s mesmerized by the entire process. 

So we it repeat it again, and again.

When we leave the bathroom, he helps me turn off the light. Hayden enjoys seeing how things work and I enjoy involving him in the process of whatever I’m doing -- even if it’s as simple as turning a life on or off. 

## 21. Does it bounce?!

Hayden loved to play with or chase a ball. So one day I took a variety of balls -- tennis ball, wooden ball, plastic ball, felt ball, and a patchwork ball -- and sat with him on the tile floor.\
\
I took one ball at a time and dropped it. 

**Did it bounce? How many times? What kind of sound did it make?**

These are the kinds of things we were studying. 

Then, I grabbed two or three balls and dropped them. 

Eventually, Hayden became an active participant. He grabbed a ball and I helped him lift it up high and drop it. 

#### Suggested Items:

A variety of balls: tennis ball, wooden ball, plastic ball, felt ball, and a patchwork ball

## 22. Shoe box fun

![activities for babies - shoe box fun](/img/activities-for-babies-shoe-box.jpeg)

Who knew a shoe box could be so interesting?! 

Well, it is. I used a shoe box during playtime with Hayden in different ways. 

I filled a shoe box with a few teethers and toys. Then I sat with Hayden and we explored them together. He loved opening and closing the shoe box lid, which proved challenging at first. He also seemed to enjoy exploring familiar toys in a new context.

The shoe box proved to be such a thrill that I iterated on it. I set a ball on top of the shoe box. Hayden crawled over and knocked it off. He loved this! 

![activities for babies - shoe box tower](/img/activities-for-babies-shoe-box-tower.jpeg)

Eventually the thrill wore off, so I added another challenge: I took an empty toy box and set this box on top of the shoe box. Then added a ball at the very top. His goal was to knock down the ball.I continued to iterate on this activity by adding more to the stack on top of the shoe box. 

#### Suggested Items:

Shoebox 

A variety of toys

## 23. Bring nature inside

![activities for babies - nature sensory board](/img/activities-for-babies-nature-sensory-board.jpeg)

Create a nature sensory board and bring nature inside.\
\
I took a walk with Hayden and brought along a few Ziplock freezer bags. I collected a few things along our way: pinecones, rocks, tree bark, leaves, and sticks.\
\
I washed everything off and let them dry overnight.

![activities for babies - exploring rocks](/img/activities-for-babies-nature-sensory-board-2.jpeg)

\
The next day, Hayden and I explored each item and I [glued](https://amzn.to/3gP8nzF) them to the [foam sheet](https://amzn.to/3zp86tI). After the glue dried, we explored board together.

![activities for babies - sensory boards](/img/activities-for-babies-nature-sensory-board-3.jpeg)

\
\
A week or so later I made another sensory board with Hayden. This time it contained household items: cotton balls, sponges, q-tips, and the like.\
\
Then we compared the nature board to the household one. The items on the boards were quite different, so there was a lot to talk about such as hard items (rocks and tree bark) compared to soft ones (cotton balls) and nature compared to manmade.

#### Suggested Items:

[Hot glue gun](https://amzn.to/3gP8nzF)

[Foam sheets](https://amzn.to/3zp86tI)

## 24. Lift-the-flap books

Lift-the-flap books are such a hit at this age!\
\
Some lift-the-flap books have flaps that are easier to use than others. 

If baby is just starting out with these books or is having trouble with them, try books by Nosy Crow, which feature felt flaps. Hayden liked the book [Where’s the Dog?](https://amzn.to/3TY6yPc) The flaps are much easier to grab and lift.

Rod Campbell’s books [Oh Dear!](https://amzn.to/3gP1w9v) and [Dear Zoo](https://amzn.to/3SEZOEE) are a great next step. There’s a small indentation for baby to stick his finger in order to lift the flap up. 

Then progress to books like, [Where’s Spot?](https://amzn.to/3SHwFbQ) by Eric Hill.

**\
Suggested Books:**

[Where’s the Dog](https://amzn.to/3TY6yPc)? by Nosy Crow

[Oh Dear!](https://amzn.to/3gP1w9v) by Rod Campbell

[Dear Zoo](https://amzn.to/3SEZOEE) by Rod Campbell

[Where’s Spot?](https://amzn.to/3SHwFbQ) by Eric Hill

## 25. Transform everyday things

![activities for babies - exploring everyday objects](/img/activities-for-babies-exploring-everyday-objects.jpeg)

This activity was such a hit with Hayden. Once again it’s an activity geared around real world objects, and once again he was completely engrossed!\
\
I took a piece of aluminum foil, parchment paper, paper towel, and a napkin. The process was the same with each.\
\
I shared each piece of material with Hayden: letting him touch and feel each one. Then, I ripped the material in half. He could hear the rip and see the results: two halves. I showed him how the two halves come together to form a whole. 

![activities for babies - exploring everyday objects](/img/activities-for-babies-exploring-everyday-objects-2.jpeg)

I took one half and made a ball with the material. So we had a ball of aluminum foil, a ball of parchment paper, and so on. We explored each ball; slid it across the table; squeezed it; dropped it on the table.\
\
Finally, I opened up each ball so Hayden could feel the wrinkled parchment paper, for example, and compared it to the other half that was still smooth.

#### Suggested items:

Aluminum foil

Parchment paper

Paper towel

Napkin 

## 26. Kitchen exploration

![activities for babies - exploring the kitchen ](/img/activities-for-babies-kitchen-exploration.jpeg)

Hayden and I have been exploring things in the kitchen for months. At this age, we took kitchen exploration to a new level. 

![activities for babies - exploring produce](/img/activities-for-babies-exploring-the-kitchen-4.jpeg)

I washed a [colander](https://amzn.to/3sysdSm) full of produce containing fruits and veggies like an apple, lemon, carrot, potato, red bell pepper, onion, and squash. We explored each piece.

![activities for babies - exploring the kitchen with mommy](/img/activities-for-babies-exploring-the-kitchen-3.jpeg)

\
He’d pick the lemon from the colander, for example, and he’d hold it. I’d talk about it. 

Then, I cut large pieces of each item to engage his senses in a different way. I cut a chunk of the lemon and held it under his nose. Then I let him touch the inside of the lemon. 

![activities for babies - exploring onions](/img/cooking-with-mommy.jpeg)

And so it went. The apple was his favorite, and the onion caught him the most by surprise!

#### Suggested items:

[Colander](https://amzn.to/3sysdSm)

A variety of fruits and veggies

Cutting board and dull knife (for parent or caregiver to use in the second part of the activity)

## 27. Hide and seek

![activities for babies - hide and seek](/img/activities-for-babies-crawl-through-a-tunnel-2.jpeg)

Hide and seek is so much fun with baby!\
\
Place a plastic bin in the middle of the room. Make sure you can’t see through it. Then, hide behind the bin and wait for baby to find you. Then hide again. This will result in so many giggles!

Add a challenge to this by adding a second bin. That way you have another hiding option.

#### Suggested items:

Large plastic bin

# 28. Create an obstacle course

![Obstacle course for baby](/img/img_9852.jpeg)

Give baby a crawling challenge by creating an obstacle course. Put a few pillows on the floor, along with a few towels, blankets, and quilts. You can even make a tunnel for baby to navigate through.

This will give baby a sensory-rich space to crawl through, over, and around. 

Add a tower for baby to knock down, partially hide a toy for baby to find, or turn a plastic container upside down for baby to flip back over. Doing so will motivate him to move through the obstacle course you’ve created, and he’ll have tons of fun in the process!

### Suggested Items:

Pillows 

Towels

Blankets

# 29. Fetch

![Baby standing ](/img/img_0082.jpeg)

Fetch is one of Hayden’s favorite games. And it’s a good thing, because it’s teaching him some useful things. \
\
Here’s how it works. First, Hayden gets a ball on top of a plastic container and pulls himself up into the standing position. He then rolls the ball off of the container.

I help him lower himself back down to the seated position -- a key skill to learn. (It’s one thing to pull yourself up, but quite another to get back down!)

He practices his balance, while sitting, by leaning over to get the ball. Then, he lifts it back up to the container and the process begins again and again and again. He loves it!

# 30. Speed bumps

Hayden loves a crawling challenge, so we do this activity often. 

I take pillows and fold up a few quilts and lay them across the room. Hayden starts at one end and navigates through the “speed bumps” until he reaches the other end, where I place a desired toy or a tower for him to knock down.
