M﻿y husband and I are adventurous eaters and enjoy good, fresh food. When Hayden began solids, I wanted him to eat a variety of foods and appreciate a good meal.

How does a mama help make that happen?!

I﻿'m not sure there's one right answer, but let me share what I’m doing -- and it doesn't involve hacks or tricks. Rather it's a different attitude. 

I think of mealtime as a learning opportunity. It’s an educational experience. And I’m convinced this is the reason why Hayden loves to try new foods, and devours a range of fruits and veggies and meals like lentil soup, garlic chicken, and black bean chili. 

When I recently introduced cauliflower to Hayden, I dipped a spoon into the puree and let him smell it. He took a small taste and paused. 

After a moment, he smiled and lifted his arms up and down excitedly. He wanted more. 

As the meal went on, I spoke about the taste, texture, and color of the cauliflower and how it was prepared. I asked Hayden questions, and waited for him to babble a response back. I gauged his body language, knowing when he’s had enough or wanted more.

And this is how mealtime goes. 

**My aim is to make mealtime a multi-sensorial experience**. Smell the food. Taste it. Hear and talk about it. 

The food experience continues outside of mealtimes, too. Hayden and I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. We’ve been doing so for months -- long before he was eating solids.

We’ll sit at the kitchen table and explore different kitchen objects, like pots, pans, spatulas, or a whisk (Hayden’s favorite).

We’ll also explore spices and herbs. He loves the smell of ground cinnamon.

Exploring fruits and veggies is one of our favorite kitchen activities. We’ll explore apples, limes, oranges, peppers, and carrots. After he touches a lemon or lime, I’ll cut it in half and he’ll smell it. Sometimes I’ll take a bite or two of an apple, and then the giggles begin. Hayden loves to hear the crunch of an apple. 

Now that Hayden can sit in his high chair, he “helps” me prepare food like his banana puree. He’s also “helped” me make brownies and pumpkin bread. 

**He’s an active participant, not a passive observer.** 

I’ll fill a measuring cup with flour. He’ll grab the handle and we’ll pour the flour into the mixing bowl. Once the batter is ready, he’ll grab the spatula and together we’ll mix the batter together.

Although he’s not eating baked goods yet, he seems to enjoy the process. He’s building useful skills, like grabbing and pouring, in a real world context. He’s also learning that bowls and measuring cups aren't just things in the world; they have a purpose. 

**The more I share about food and involve him, the more he seems to love food and mealtime in general.** 

Mealtime isn’t something we dread. Rather, it’s a lot of fun -- for baby and mommy.
