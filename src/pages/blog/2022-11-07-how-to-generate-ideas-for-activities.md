Simple toys and objects make playtime a blast. 

I placed an empty laundry basket and a tennis ball on the floor in Hayden’s playroom. I was watching from about two feet away when something interesting happened. 

Hayden picked up the tennis ball with his right hand and extended his arm up in the air. He kept it there for a few seconds. Then, he turned his wrist so it hung over the basket and opened his hand. The ball dropped into the basket. 

He proceeded to tip the basket down on its side in order to retrieve the ball. He then turned the basket to its original position. The process repeated over and over again. 

## What If . . . 

I’ll never know for sure what he was thinking. He mostly babbles right now. But by observing his body language and how he interacted with these simple objects, my guess is that he asked himself a simple question that began with these words: “what if …?” 

*What if* I pick up the tennis ball, lift it in the air, and drop it into the basket? 

*What if* I tip the basket over? Will the ball still be there? 

*What if* I turn the basket back to its original position and try it again? 

*What if* I do this same thing over and over again? Will I get the same result?

**Asking “what if …” questions is a way I think of activities to do with him**. I start with a simple question that I’m curious about myself and see if Hayden is equally interested. He almost always is. 

## One Question Leads to Another

This morning I thought I’d experiment using painters tape with Hayden. It began with a simple question: *what if* I put some painters tape on the side of a plastic storage container? Will Hayden pull it off?

He did. **So this led me to more questions**. 

*What if* I put the tape on the top of a plastic storage container? Will he pull himself up to access the top of the storage container, and pull off the tape?

He did. 

*What if* I put a piece of tape on his hand or foot? Will he pull it off?

He did this, too.

*What if* I tape some balls to the top of a plastic storage container? Will he pull himself up, pull off the ball -- and the tape? 

He did, but it proved to be more of a challenge.

And so it goes with nearly every activity we do together. One simple “what if …” question leads to another, and another. It’s the best way to generate ideas. 

## Keep It Simple

The simpler the toy or object, the better when asking “what if . . .” questions. **Simple toys and objects can take on a variety of uses**. Whereas complex toys usually have a single use value or purpose.  

Take a shoe box as an example. The first time I introduced a shoe box to Hayden, he was interested in -- and challenged by -- lifting the lid. Then, I filled the box with balls and he opened the lid and pulled out the balls.

Then, I put a ball on top of the box, and he delighted in rolling it off. Then, I made a tower for him to knock down, which consisted of the shoe box, another empty box, and a ball on the very top. He delighted in knocking the ball off. Then, I cut a hole in the top of the box so he could drop a ball through it. 

**I made these iterations by asking myself “what if …” along the way**. Because a shoe box is so simple, it’s served many different purposes during playtime. 

You have much more freedom with simple toys and objects; you’re often constrained with complex ones. That’s why real world, every day objects, like a tennis ball and laundry basket, are great for play time. **Keep it simple. Keep it real. And ask “what if …” questions. The possibilities are endless**.
