Creating activities for babies is easier than you think. 

I placed an empty laundry basket and a tennis ball on the floor in Hayden’s playroom. I was watching from about two feet away when something interesting happened. 

Hayden picked up the tennis ball with his right hand and extended his arm up in the air. He kept it there for a few seconds. Then, he turned his wrist so it hung over the basket and opened his hand. The ball dropped into the basket. 

He proceeded to tip the basket down on its side in order to retrieve the ball. He then turned the basket to its original position. The process repeated over and over again. 

## What If . . . 

I’ll never know for sure what he was thinking. He mostly babbles right now. But by observing his body language and how he interacted with these simple objects, my guess is that he asked himself a simple question that began with these words: “what if …?” 

*What if* I pick up the tennis ball, lift it in the air, and drop it into the basket? 

*What if* I tip the basket over? Will the ball still be there? 

*What if* I turn the basket back to its original position and try it again? 

*What if* I do this same thing over and over again? Will I get the same result?

**Asking “what if …” questions is a way I think of activities to do with him**. I start with a simple question that I’m curious about myself and see if Hayden is equally interested. He almost always is. 

## One Question Leads to Another

This morning I thought I’d experiment using painters tape with Hayden. It began with a simple question: *what if* I put some painters tape on the side of a plastic storage container? Will Hayden pull it off?

He did. **So this led me to more questions**. 

*What if* I put the tape on the top of a plastic storage container? Will he pull himself up to access the top of the storage container, and pull off the tape?

He did. 

*What if* I put a piece of tape on his hand or foot? Will he pull it off?

He did this, too.

*What if* I tape some balls to the top of a plastic storage container? Will he pull himself up, pull off the ball -- and the tape? 

He did, but it proved to be more of a challenge.

And so it goes with nearly every activity we do together. One simple “what if …” question leads to another, and another. It’s a great way to generate ideas.

## What’s Baby Interested In?

Another way to think of ideas is to give baby [unstructured play time](https://www.learningbabies.com/blog/2022-10-03-babies-need-unstructured-playtime-too/). This is a great way to reveal baby’s interests.

\
Put a few toys or objects out and sit back and watch. See what baby gravitates toward and spends his time. Then, use your observations to create fun activities for baby. Use “what if …?” questions to iterate on the activities you come up with.

Hayden always gravitated toward his [object permanence box](https://amzn.to/3Dek3n1) toy, where he’d drop a ball in the circular hole and it’d roll back out to him, during unstructured play time. So I iterated on it. I created a little [basketball hoop](https://www.learningbabies.com/activities-7-8-months) for him to drop the ball through. 

He loved it. 

So I iterated on it again by asking: what if I cut the bottom out of a cylinder-shaped bread crumbs container? Then, Hayden could drop a ball or small block through the hole. 

This, too, was a hit.

It’s not too surprising, either. **People -- including babies -- are more engaged with things and activities that they’re interested in**. Once you know this, then iterate on it by asking “what if ..?” questions and you’ll have a surplus of activities to try.
