# Activities 9-10 Months



## 1. Create a nature sensory corner

![Nature sensory corner - learning babies](/img/3e6d3d61-4d54-4a7b-9bdc-2e3688b5bf51.jpeg)

I keep a small nature corner that contains rocks, shells, and (because it’s fall) a few pumpkins. Hayden loves to sit down and toggle among the different items. 



We compare and contrast the different shapes, colors, textures, and sizes. We practice making small stacks. And we just enjoy the fact that there’s some nature inside our home.



Hayden makes it over to his nature corner multiple times each day, without prompting from me, to investigate. He loves it!

#### Suggested Items:

A small collection of rocks, shells, pumpkins, or tree bark

Sensory boards

Plants



## 2. Sponge time!

![Exploring a natural sponge - learning babies](/img/8619dacd-cff0-4741-a463-4ede48d628c4-1-.jpeg)

I thought it’d be neat to introduce a natural sea sponge to Hayden. The verdict is in: he loved it! 



He held it in his hands and turned it around and around, intrigued by the texture and shape. I explored the sponge with him. For example, I balled the sponge into my hand so he could see how it changes shapes.



Then the real fun began. 

![Exploring a natural sponge in water - learning babies](/img/a9bd6c29-4d94-4ed9-9b11-ec5831be021d.jpeg)

I filled a small bin with water and dropped the sponge in. He moved it around the water, and eventually it got saturated and sank. 

![A sponge filled with water - learning babies](/img/1d61e15c-aa1f-4ba0-ba94-899ac4aa2c3f.jpeg)

So he pulled the sponge out and squeezed water from the sponge onto his lap. This repeated several times. He got soaked. But water makes for an easy clean up!



I also filled the sponge with water and lifted my arm up high above the bin. Then, I squeezed the water out of the sponge so Hayden could see, feel, and hear the water drip out.

Bin



## 3. Practice standing with a mirror

Baby will be more than willing to practice their newfound skill, standing. But using a mirror has made it a lot of fun for Hayden.



I put a plastic crate against a wall and propped up a mirror. So when Hayden pulls himself up, he sees himself in the mirror. He thinks it’s so funny!



Then he’ll lower himself to the floor only to pull himself back up to get another look in the mirror. You can also put an activity on the surface of the container, so baby can watch himself as he works on a set of stacking cups, puzzle, or ball drop.



## 4. Let’s color

This is a great age to pull out some crayons and color with baby! The art itself is pretty basic, but that’s no matter. 



It’s fun for baby to make these sweeping marks across paper. In fact, that seemed to thrill Hayden the most the first few times we colored. He seemed to be amazed that he could make these large strokes of color appear on the paper. 



I used painter’s tape around the paper to keep it in place.

## 5. Build a tower

Have baby help you make a tower. At this age, this tower may only consist of two or three items. But it’s a start, and it’s a great way to help build hand-eye coordination and teach baby how to balance items. 



I found it helpful to use large objects to give Hayden an easier target. I took an empty container of bread crumbs and set a ball next to it. Hayden picked up the ball and put it on top of the container. He was so proud of himself, and proceeded to knock down the ball and build the tower again -- and again and again. 



Increase the difficulty by changing the base of the tower, like an empty nut, yogurt, or cottage cheese container. An empty water bottle will give baby a challenge, too!



You can also change the stacking object. You can use different sized balls, as well as rattles or objects from daily life.  

#### Suggested Items:

A variety of empty containers, such as cottage cheese, yogurt, nut, or bread crumbs containers)

A variety of stacking objects, such as balls, blocks, rattles, or every day items



## 6. Roadblocks

Here’s a fun way to give baby problem-solving practice. Create a tower of objects to knock down, and surround it by pillows and blankets. Then, set some empty boxes, like shoe boxes, around the pillows and blankets. 

Now baby has to figure out how to get to the tower. 



Should he move the box? Go around it? Go over it? 



There are many different possibilities! 



## 7. Pots n’ Pans

Pull out some items from your kitchen -- a skillet, saucepan with a lid, colander, and a few kitchen utensils (whisk, measuring cups, and spatula) -- and let baby explore!



Hayden is fascinated by all things kitchen, and this activity never gets old. He enjoys running his fingers along the holes of the colander. He likes to pull off the lid to the saucepan. He’ll bang the wood spoon on the skillet and hear the sound. And he loves to hear and feel the vibrations of the whisk when you hit it against the pan. The possibilities are endless.

#### Suggested Items:

A variety of kitchen items: a skillet, saucepan with a lid,  colander, and a few kitchen utensils (whisk, measuring cups, and spatula)

## 8. Catch -- revisited

[I wrote about playing catch](https://www.learningbabies.com/activities-5-6-months/#3-catch) with baby when he’s 5-6 months old, when you sit with baby on your lap at the table and roll the ball to him. He has to extend his arm and “catch” the ball. 



Now you can play the same game while baby stands up -- a skill he’s more than willing to practice! 



Here’s how I played this game with Hayden. 



Hayden would pull himself up to a plastic crate. I’d roll a small wooden ball to him as he stood. It sounds easy, but he was working on two different skills: standing and catching, which takes a lot of hand eye coordination. 

#### Suggested Items:

Small ball



## 9. Real life nested objects

Nest real life objects. Baby will love it! 



I’d have Hayden watch me as I put a ball on the floor, and covered it with an empty cottage cheese container, followed by an empty plastic bin, followed by a laundry basket. 



I added the laundry basket once Hayden got the hang of this activity because it’s hard to flip over at first. 



But the point is this: use items from your home and nest an object for baby to find. In fact, Hayden enjoys when I use items with different textures, like a small wicker basket. He’ll love pulling off each layer until he finds his coveted prize!

## 10. Basket of real world objects

Instead of a basket of toys in your playroom, try a basket of real world objects: empty water bottles, as well as egg cartons and yogurt, cottage cheese, or nut containers are a place to start. 



There are so many possibilities from here. First, baby will enjoy simply exploring these objects. An empty water bottle is one of Hayden’s favorite things. A close second is the empty cottage cheese container, which he enjoys flipping over and getting it to roll on its side.  



Another idea is to stick a few balls or teethers in a container and have baby pull off the lid and then pull out each object. 



These kinds of containers, due to their large size, can also give baby practice stacking.



## 11. Real life ball drop

Once baby figures out to stand, he’ll love to practice it. And most babies love to play with a ball. So combine them and make a real life ball drop. 



Start by placing a ball on top of a piece of furniture or something else that baby likes to use to pull himself up with. In Hayden’s case, it’s a plastic storage bin. Then, place a container next to it on the floor. 



Ask baby to drop the ball into the container that’s on the floor. Start with something the size of a plastic bath bin. Once this gets old, use something smaller like an empty cottage cheese or yogurt container. 



After the ball is in the container, then help baby lower himself down (if he can’t do this himself yet), lean over, and retrieve the ball. 



As you can imagine, there’s a lot at work here for baby: pulling, lowering, dropping, leaning. But it’s so much fun for baby!



## 12. Does it balance?

Take an empty container, such as a yogurt, nut, or cottage cheese container, and have baby place a ball on top. Can baby get the ball to balance without having it fall off?!



It seems so simple. But it can be a challenge. Then, baby will get the hang of it and want to do it over and over again!



Take it up a level with different containers or different sized balls. Hayden’s patchwork ball is large and has to use two hands. Whereas he can grab a tennis ball with one hand. 



You can also offer different objects all together. Pull out those newborn rattles and see if baby can balance a rattle on top of a container. 



## 13. Hand puppets

It took less than two minutes to make a hand puppet for Hayden, and he loves it!



I took one of my husband’s black socks and cut out two eyes and a mouth out of construction paper that I have on hand for art projects. I taped the face on the sock and my puppet was complete. 



Hayden loves when I make the puppet “talk” or “sing.” He also loves to chase after it. So if you’re looking for a way to get baby to move, then this is it! Get your puppet “talking” and baby will come dashing for it!

#### Suggested Items:

Sock

Construction paper



## 14. Follow directions

Here’s an activity that can help baby learn the names of objects and learn how to follow simple directions. 



I ask Hayden to do simple things with objects and toys he enjoys playing with.



“Can you please place the ball on the container?”



“Can you please drop the ball into the bucket?” 



“Can you please take the lid off of the container?”



I point to the object as I ask my question. Hayden thinks this activity is so much fun! I’m glad because there’s a lot to gain from it. He’s learning that things in the world have names. He’s also learning to follow directions. 



## 15. Fun with gelatin

This sensory activity is such a hit! I made gelatin for Hayden one evening once he went to bed. We explored it the next day and he loved it!



I used [unflavored gelatin](https://amzn.to/3XL5TmE). Instead of juice, as the recipe suggests, I used water. It’s a snap to make. 



I cut the gelatin into large pieces and put them into a small bowl. I sat with Hayden on an old bed sheet (to contain the mess) on the floor, and we explored. 



He just poked at it initially. Then, he grabbed a chunk, felt it squish in his hands, and saw it crumble into pieces. I held up another chunk and wiggled it, so he could see how it moved. I also broke a piece in half so he could see how easily the gelatin changed shapes. 



And, of course, we both experienced how sticky gelatin can be. 



You can iterate on this activity by pouring the gelatin in an ice cube tray or put it on a cookie sheet and use cookie cutters to make shapes.

## 16. Learning to take turns

Hayden loves to roll a ball and chase after it. A recent fascination is rolling the ball to me, and then I roll the ball back to him. 



I’m quick to point out that we’re taking turns. 



“Mommy rolls the ball to Hayden,” and I proceed to roll the ball. Hayden grabs it and I ask him to roll it back: “Can you please roll the ball back to mommy?”



He gets the idea and we go back and forth for some time.



## 17. Edible play dough 

I loved playing with play dough as a kid, and was thrilled when I [came across a recipe](https://www.thelifeofjenniferdawn.com/2010/08/oatmeal-playdough.html) for homemade play dough that’s suitable for babies!



The fun began with Hayden helping me make the play dough, which contains three simple ingredients: oats, water, flour. I filled a measuring cup with oats and Hayden “helped” me dump it into the bowl. 



Running his fingers through dried oats is one of Hayden’s favorite sensory activities. So he played around with the oats for a bit before we added the remaining ingredients.



The play dough got clumpy. It got sticky. It got a bit messy. But it was a blast! Hayden loved taking clumps of the mixture into his hands and squeezing it. 



I recommend doing this activity on an old blanket or bed sheet. Then, pop it in the washer after the activity. 



## 18. Make your own lift-the-flap book

Hayden loves lift-the-flap books. So one evening I made my own for Hayden. 



I took a foam sheet and a few pictures I have of Hayden and our family. I used a glue gun to adhere the pictures to the foam sheet. Then, I cut pieces of construction paper to cover the pictures.  



This activity worked really well. Of course Hayden loves to lift the flaps. But he also enjoys seeing pictures of people he knows, like mommy and daddy!

## 19. Tennis ball fun

A tennis ball is one of Hayden’s favorite things. This fascination began months ago when I’d drop the ball and he’d watch it bounce. 



Fast forward many months later and the novelty hasn’t worn off yet! 



But now he likes to make the ball bounce himself and chase after it. Then repeat -- again, and again, and again. 



## 20. Fun with tape and other stuff

I’m a huge fan of using simple, everyday items with baby. That’s because you have much more freedom with simple toys and objects; you’re often constrained with complex ones.



So one day I decided to experiment with painter’s tape. 



I put a few pieces of tape on top of a plastic container in Hayden’s playroom. He pulled himself up to the container and ripped them off. 



I took it a step further. I took a few plastic balls and taped them down to the container. Once again Hayden pulled himself up to the container and ripped them off, though he had trouble getting the tape off of the ball. 



Then, I took a piece of tape and placed it on his hand. He had to figure out how to rip it off, which proved to be a challenge -- it kept sticking to him each time he touched it!



Simple. Fun. Educational.

## 21. Explore differences

Hayden loves to explore things from nature. So I took some rocks and shells and we explored them -- and the differences between them. 



First, we looked at them while sitting on the floor and explored the weight, color, and texture of the rocks compared to the shells. The shells have ridges, for example, the rocks are smooth. The rocks are heavier than the shells. And so on



Then, we explored rocks and shells in water. What happens when I drop a rock in the water? What happens when I drop a shell into the water? Hayden could see and feel (from the splashes!) the difference. Then, because water makes everything better, Hayden enjoyed splashing around in the water and grabbing the rocks and shells.



#### Suggested Items:

Shells, rocks, branches, pumpkins . . . the list goes on and on!

## 22. Down to business

I use a blue pen to track Hayden’s milk feeds in my [Baby’s Weekly and Daily Baby Log Book](https://www.learningbabies.com/baby-log/). Hayden keeps a watchful eye as I write. So one day I put the lid end of the pen in his hand and he (eventually) pulled it off. Together we put the pen cap back on. 



We’ve done this so many times, and it hasn’t gotten old. 



He loves this simple “game” so much that we explored the box of business supplies by my desk in my office. It contains basic business things like post-it notes, cards, tape, and rubber bands. Of course few things in this box aren’t baby friendly, so I kept a watchful eye.



It was good practice for Hayden to see some more real world items in the environment where I use them. It also gave him experience exploring objects that aren’t baby friendly with an adult.  

## 23. Spoons

A spoon is one of Hayden's favorite kitchen items! So one afternoon, I took a variety of spoons -- espresso spoon, baby spoon, soup spoon, slotted spoon, and serving spoon -- and put them on a towel for him to explore. 



And that he did! 



He touched them. He put them into his mouth. He banged them together. He looked at his reflection. This was such a hit!



## 24. Cup of Tea

Making a cup of tea may be old news for you, but not for baby! Pull out a box and let baby explore. 



My husband loves decaffeinated peppermint tea. So we made some tea for him. 



Hayden loved the challenge of opening the box, then pulling out each tea bag one at a time. Later, once he was done exploring, I opened up the plastic wrap around the tea bag and let him smell and touch it. 



Then, we explored a mug. That way he’d understand what to do with a tea bag. It was also a useful practice in exploring breakable things with an adult, since the mug is ceramic. 



Then we put the tea bag into the mug, and left it to my husband to add the boiling water.



I have to say, I was surprised by how much Hayden enjoyed this one! We’ve done it many times and it hasn’t gotten old.



## 25. Everything’s better on the grass

One of the best sensorial activities is to simply sit on the grass with baby or let him crawl around on it. 



Sitting, crawling, and exploring the grass -- and everything on it, like branches and leaves -- are tons of fun for baby. Hayden and I have been doing this for a long time, and the novelty hasn’t worn off yet!



It’s equally fun to sit down with Hayden and blow bubbles and see them land on the grass. Also, I often bring a bag with a few things, such as a ball, empty plastic container, and a few shells or pine cones, as we head to the backyard. And we play and explore. 



I also find that Hayden is even more focused when we’re outside. A different context makes all of the difference.



## 26. Sensory Bottles

I tried introducing sensory bottles to Hayden in the past without success. He wasn’t into them. 



Now he is!



In advance, I let a few Voss water bottles dry out overnight. I like these bottles because they’re large and roll easily on the floor. 



Then, the next morning Hayden and I created a few sensory bottles. We explored the items that would ultimately go into the bottles together first, like rubber bands, pasta noodles, rice, and dried beans. Obviously, these aren’t baby-safe materials which is why we touched, explored, and talked about them together. 



Then, he helped me drop the items into the bottles. The dried pasta went into one bottle. The rubber bands went into another. And so on. 



His two favorite bottles were the ones with rice and dried beans. They were fun to shake and bang against the table and hear the resulting sounds. But the real fun occurred when Hayden went chasing them around the floor. He loved watching the bottles -- and the contents -- roll and make noise.



It’s also so much fun for Hayden when I use one of these rice or bean bottles as a rainmaker.

## 27. Climb a mountain

Hayden loves to climb. So I pulled out a bunch of pillows and make different configurations he can climb over. 



I began by making a triangle with three pillows. I put a toy or object on top to entice him. I’ve also created a stack of two or three pillows for him to crawl over. And I’ve also created inclines at different levels as he’s become stronger and more comfortable with climbing.



#### Suggested Items:

Pillows
