title: Welcome to Learning Babies!
---
Do you have a little one and wonder:

* What **activities** should I use as my baby grows?
* What **developmental toys** should I introduce and when? And where can I buy them?
* What **books** should I read to my baby?

I’m Amy, and I’m a writer turned stay at home mom. I’d repeatedly ask myself these questions each month or two as my son, Hayden, got older. I couldn’t find answers to these questions all in one place, so I created Learning Babies.

It provides **simple and easy activities organized by age**, from 0 to 6 months. I incorporate a little bit of everything: art, nature, sensory play, music, reading, and cooking. I also include the supplies you need and where you can buy them for each activity. 

I’ll continue to add content for older babies and toddlers over time. So sign up for my newsletter for updates, as well as practical child development ideas.

I’ve also compiled useful developmental toys by age and a list of books for babies. 

Learning through play is a lot of fun when you have the resources you need to do your job. I hope this website can help you along your journey.
