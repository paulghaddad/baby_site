title: Welcome to Learning Babies!
---
Do you have a little one and wonder what activities to use as your baby grows?

I get it!

I’m Amy, and I’m a writer and programmer turned stay-at-home mom. I asked the same question each month as my son, Hayden, got older. 

So I created Learning Babies. It provides **simple, easy, and inexpensive activities organized by age**. I incorporate a little bit of everything: art, nature, sensory play, music, reading, and cooking. 

Learning Babies goes **back to basics** by using simple toys and real world objects. (A ball and shoe box can be educational and loads of fun!) **Simple activities means endless possibilities. Let creativity thrive!**

I’ll continue to add content for older babies over time. So sign up for [my newsletter](https://www.learningbabies.com/newsletter) for updates and practical child development ideas. ﻿
