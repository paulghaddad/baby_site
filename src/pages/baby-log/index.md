I was a sleep-deprived, first-time parent looking to establish a routine and monitor my newborn’s day: feeds, activities, sleep, diapers, and supplements. As a nursing new mom with a low birth weight baby, I also needed to track my baby’s weight. And I wanted to document all of the special moments we had together each week. How do I stay organized with all of these details, while running on little sleep?\
\
Baby’s Weekly & Daily Log Book was the solution.\
\
It’s organized by feed, so I was reassured that my breastfed baby was getting enough to eat: I could record the feeding time, duration of feed, and breast rotation. Plus, I used the weight tracker to ensure he was gaining weight.\
\
I established a routine with my baby by keeping track of his activities and sleep and by filling out the weekly and daily reflection questions, which helped me to spot patterns. This meant more predictability and more sleep -- for mom and baby!\
\
When I noticed a change in my son’s behavior, like when he hit the four-month sleep regression and later began teething, I’d review through the weekly and daily reflection pages to see if a change in his feeds, activities, or nap times affected him. It’s what I needed to get back on track.\
\
Baby’s Weekly & Daily Log Book is a special memento of how my baby has changed and the special times we have together. One day my baby boy will read -- in my handwriting -- my notes and observations, as well as the details of each day.
