# Activities 0-12 Weeks

## 1. Artist baby

![Abstract art](/img/pexels-steve-johnson-1269968.jpg)

I began sharing my passion for art with Hayden very early on. I purchased the Art Page-A-Day Gallery calendar. 

Then, I tore off a few pages from a calendar. **We’d lay side-by-side on our backs on his playmat to look at beautiful artwork and “talk”about them.**

I’d point out and describe what I saw; I’d also ask him questions, always pausing for him to respond back with a coo, grunt, or even a smile.

This was such a hit!

**So I did the same thing with baby animals and beautiful places**. I purchased a baby animal and national park calendars. 

This activity is especially fun now that he’s older and much more talkative; he loves to babble in response to my comments and questions.

## 2. Customize your play gym

![Play gym with black and white cards ](/img/image_2.jpg)

Early on, Hayden wasn’t engaging with some of the items that came with his play gym.

S﻿o I customized it myself with three black and white cards.

I punched a hole in each one and attached it to the play gym structure with a string. The cards dangled from the top of the play gym. There are images on both sides of the cards, which made them fun to look at -- especially when they moved.

![Play gym with objects ](/img/img_8749.jpeg)

This worked great until he was ready to grasp objects. 

So I customized it again. 

I took objects -- rattles and teethers -- and attached them to the play gym with [red ribbon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091GNB79S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). He loved the challenge of grabbing objects overhead or kicking them with his feet. I made the objects low enough so he could engage his hands and feet.

## 3. The many uses of mobiles

![baby looking at mobile](/img/image_3.jpg)

Babies love mobiles! And so should you -- because you can use them in many different ways.

**I strategically placed a mobile over Hayden’s changing table**. This made diaper changes hassle free. He was mesmerized by the swirls above him -- especially when they moved.

![mobiles](/img/2fe15ecd-f4a1-4349-b320-c19aac68baf4.jpeg)

**I used mobiles above Hayden’s play quilt**, where he’d stretch his arms and legs watching and reacting to the shapes floating above him.

These mobiles were a gift that kept on giving because I used them in different ways as my baby got older and more advanced.

In addition to using these mobiles overhead, **I also used them during tummy time**. This gave Hayden a different perspective. Because mobiles are so fun to look at, they motivated him to lift that heavy head! 

Then, as he began to become more mobile on his tummy, I used the mobiles to encourage Hayden to rotate. I’d hold a mobile in front of him, then slowly move around his playmat and he’d follow me.

## 4. Rattle, rattle, rattle

![Baby holding rattle](/img/img_8629.jpeg)

A rattle is a basic toy that can serve many purposes. **Use it to get your baby accustomed to different textures and sounds**. That’s why I found it useful to have several rattles. 

Rattles also got my baby accustomed to opening and closing his hands to grasp objects.

![baby holding rattle](/img/image_5.jpg)

Here’s what I mean. You hold one end of the rattle and place the other end toward your baby’s hand. The idea is to have your baby grasp the other end of the rattle. 

He may need some prodding. So gently tap his fingers with the opposite end of the rattle. If this doesn’t work, then take his fingers and place them around the opposite end of the rattle to show him how to grasp. 

Once baby has grasped the rattle, then you grab the other end and shake the rattle with him so he can hear the sounds it makes. 

**You can also use a rattle for visual tracking**. Have your baby engage with the rattle, then move it side to side. 

Another way to use a rattle is to shake it and **see if your baby turns their head in response to the noise**.

## 5. Let’s talk

![Talking to baby](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-10.24.51-am.png)

Talk with your baby as much as possible! 

What should you talk about? Anything and everything!

Tell him about your day, what you’re having for dinner, what it was like during your childhood, a trip you’ve taken or want to take. 

You can also talk as you do things with your baby, like dressing him. For example, “I’m putting the blue sock on your right foot.” 

Make eye contact with your baby and have a conversation. Ask him a question, then pause and wait for an answer. Give him time to coo, grunt, or make other noises in return. 

## 6. Make time for book time 

![Reading books](/img/740a5bee-fcae-4675-865c-9d10fe76ac63.jpeg)

It’s never too early to start reading. I began reading to Hayden as soon as we got home from the hospital, and we haven’t stopped!

Early on, I read while holding him.

But I soon found it more comfortable to lay on our backs, side-by-side on his playmat, where I’d hold the book above his head. I found this position to be easier and more comfortable. There was less to juggle!

#### **Suggested books:**

Panda Bear, Panda Bear What Do You See? by Bill Martin Jr.

## 7. Let the music play

Turn on some beautiful music and listen for a few minutes. 

I like to expose my baby to a range of music, and we talk about it. “Do you hear the drums?” Or “I hear a piano and flute.” 

You can also sing to your baby -- and you should! Don’t worry about having a bad voice or sounding out of tune, like I do. 

Just sing and maybe even sway back and forth to the tune. Or simply singing “lalalala” repeatedly is fun for your baby. 

#### **Suggested item:**

## 8. Study faces

Make time for your baby to study -- faces that is. 

My baby loves to study faces. It’s a fascination that began early on and continues to this day.

We’d lay on his playmat and explore each others’ face. Sometimes I let him explore my face: I’d take his hand and touch my face and point out different facial features. “This is mommy’s nose,” I’d say as I’d guide his hand to touch my nose. 

Other times, I’d point out different parts of his face: nose, ears, chin, etc. “This is Hayden’s nose,” I’d say as I’d point to his nose. 

**A mirror is handy to have around for this activity**. That way, it’s a multi-sensorial experience: baby can see where his nose is, and hear and feel you point out each facial feature. 

Besides, babies love to look at themselves in the mirror -- so it’s definitely a worthy purchase.

**Baby can also study faces by looking at pictures of babies**. Books about babies, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), worked great for this activity. 

These books also work great during tummy time. Prop open a book and lay it against a wall, so baby has something interesting to look at while on his tummy.

## 9. The great outdoors

![Tree](/img/niko-photos-tgtvxeor_rs-unsplash.jpg)

**Step out to your backyard or go to a park and explore the great outdoors**!

This may seem mundane to you, but being outside is all new territory for baby! 

I’d hold my baby and walk around our backyard, narrating what I’d see and hear, as my baby took in this different environment. 

**Point out the sights and sounds you’re experiencing**. For example, “I hear the birds chirping.” Or “do you feel the breeze?!” 

You can also **introduce elements of nature:** pull off a leaf from a tree or pick a flower, show it to him, and have him touch it.

## 10. Engage baby with black and white high contrast cards

![black and white cards hanging from play gym](/img/image_2.jpg)

We know that black and white cards matter for babies. But did you realize the many different ways you can engage baby with them?! 

**Hang black and white cards from your play gym**. That’s what I did. My baby wasn’t engaging with the items that came with his play gym at first. So I added my own.

I took three [](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DLR33HG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)black and white cards, punched a hole in each one and attached them to the play gym with a string. The cards dangled from the top of the play gym. There were images on both sides of the cards, which make them fun to look at -- especially when they moved.

Eventually, he learned to bat at the cards and loved making them move!

Other times I attached the cards to the top of the play gym and to the side of it -- taking full use of the play gym structure. This also gets him to move his head in different directions. My baby loved finding the cards everywhere he looked. 

**Visual tracking is another way to use black and white cards**. 

Show a card to your baby and let him engage with it. Then, slowly move the card from one side to the other. The idea is that your baby’s eyes stay glued to the card as they move their head side to side.

![baby laying on his side, looking at black and white cards](/img/image_1.jpg)

**You can also place your baby on their side. Then, prop up a card or two across from them**. 

To keep your baby on their side, you may find it useful to roll up a small towel and put it behind their backside for support. This is a great way for baby to get practice laying on his side.

## 11. Make tummy time fun!

![tummy time](/img/3e2a9333-c40b-495b-a709-23719b48bf3c.jpeg)

One day baby will love being on his tummy. Until that day comes, make tummy time fun and interesting with the ideas below.

While baby is on his tummy on his playmat: 

* **Prop up some black and white cards** against the wall for baby to look at. 
* **Lean a mirror against the wall** so baby can look at himself.  
* **Prop a board book against the wall**, and let baby look at the images. Babies love looking at other babies. So I’d open up books, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), while Hayden was on his tummy.
* **Use a mobile during tummy time**. Hayden loved this! It offered a new perspective and motivated him to lift that heavy head!

I’d also tear a few pages from daily calendars of baby animals ([Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)) or artwork ([Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2)) and line the wall with them. Hayden was mesmerized!

Tummy time can be really hard for baby. 

![tummy time using a pillow](/img/bfa6fbfd-b401-4120-84ab-448ca2f40075.jpeg)

Ease him into it by using a nursing pillow to prop up baby.

You can also have baby lay on your chest as you lay flat on the floor or on a couch. 

Or sit at an incline and rest baby on your chest. I found this way to be very effective early on; it was much easier for my baby to lift that heavy head.

# Activities 3-4 Months

## 1. Breakfast with mommy (or daddy)

![breakfast with mommy](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.00.34-pm.png)

After I fed Hayden in the morning, he’d join me at the kitchen table where I’d have my breakfast. “Breakfast with mommy,” as I later called it, turned into a fun daily ritual with a lot of benefits. 

Hayden would sit in his [BabyBjörn bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Cotton/dp/B00BQYVOKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2NUUQWVU6ML1B&keywords=bjorn+baby+bouncer&qid=1663166078&s=home-garden&sprefix=bajorn+baby+bouncer%2Cgarden%2C85&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTk4xQ1ZZRExQRUw5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzY3NjU2MUg2TzZNVUFBMUxXMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTA3MzE4MVNSMUszTVI1SUNGTyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), which was placed near the kitchen table, as I showed -- **and involved** -- him in the breakfast preparation.

I’d open the bag of frozen blueberries and bring them over to him to let him take a look.  

Then, I’d go over to the kitchen cupboard and pull out a bowl. I’d bring it over to him and let him explore it with me. He loved to touch it, as I’d **talk about the color, texture, and weight**. I’d do the same thing with a spoon, placemat, and napkin, along with any other breakfast items. 

**The process mesmerized him**. 

He’d watch carefully as I’d pour some cereal into a bowl and sprinkle a few berries on top. I’d kneel down to his level so he could see and hear me pour orange juice into my glass.

Once breakfast was made, I’d sit at the table and talk with Hayden as I ate. 

I’d ask him a question and then pause as I’d take a bite and wait for him to respond with a coo, grunt, or squeal. 

This would go on until I finished whatever I was eating. Then, we’d go play. The entire process only took 10 to 15 minutes, but the benefits were many:

* **Explore real world kitchen objects and put them to use in a real way**. A bowl, for example, isn’t just another thing in the world; we can use it to hold food. 
* **Model eating and table manners** -- skills that’ll pay dividends when baby begins eating in the near future.  
* **Teach conversational skills**. Ask a question. Pause, and let baby respond, while you take a bite. 

Above all, “breakfast with mommy” is a way to teach patience. 

At first, Haden would only last a few minutes in his bouncer. He was anxious to get up and play. But over time his patience grew, and so did his intrigue with the entire breakfast process, both preparation and cleanup.

## 2. Grab or kick it 

![play gym](/img/img_8749.jpeg)

**Make grasping objects fun for baby**.

I took some of Hayden's favorite rattles and teethers and hung them from his play gym with [red ribbon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091GNB79S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). That way, they were low enough so he could grab them with his hands and put them in his mouth. 

This setup was also a great way to get him using his feet. 

The objects were low enough for him to kick, which he loved to do! I liked the [Baby Bear Wooden Rattle Shaker](https://www.bellalunatoys.com/collections/waldorf-baby-toys-0-12-months/products/green-tones-baby-bear-shaker) for this reason. It was a wide enough target for baby.

**Also consider handing baby an object to explore while he sits in a [baby bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Cotton/dp/B00BQYVOKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2NUUQWVU6ML1B&keywords=bjorn+baby+bouncer&qid=1663166078&s=home-garden&sprefix=bajorn+baby+bouncer%2Cgarden%2C85&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTk4xQ1ZZRExQRUw5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzY3NjU2MUg2TzZNVUFBMUxXMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTA3MzE4MVNSMUszTVI1SUNGTyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)**.

## 3. The many uses of mobiles

![baby with mobile](/img/img_8755.jpeg)

Mobiles can have new uses during these months. 

Sure, you can **hang a mobile overhead** for baby. But that’s just the start. 

**Get baby kicking** by laying baby on their back on their playmat. Then, dangle a mobile just above their feet.  

You can also **use a mobile during tummy time**. 

Get baby on his tummy, then dangle the mobile in front of him or to the side. Hayden loved this! It gave him a new perspective, as well as the motivation he needed to lift that heavy head.

#### Suggested Item:

## 4. **More tummy time fun!**

![Tummy time](/img/img_8850.jpeg)

Use props to make tummy time fun!

**Babies love looking at other babies**. That’s why I’d open up a board book about baby faces, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and propped it up in front of Hayden. He loved this! I’d turn the pages periodically to keep things interesting.

![Tummy time with mirror](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.23.30-pm.png)

**Mirrors are also a lot of fun for babies**. They love to look at themselves! So place baby on his tummy and prop up a mirror in front of him. 

I also found it useful to **prop up pictures of artwork or baby animals** for him to look at during tummy time. I got these pictures from daily calendars ([Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2) and [Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)). I’d select a few pictures and place them in front of him, which he absolutely loved.

**Mobiles were another favorite** tummy time item. 

Get baby on his belly, then dangle the mobile in front of baby or to the side. Babies love mobiles, and provide the motivation to lift that heavy head!

![Tummy time with toys](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-8.59.15-pm.png)

And you can **always put an enticing toy in front of baby** while he’s on his tummy.

## 5. Sit up and explore

![Baby sitting up looking at toys](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-8.56.36-pm.png)

Although sitting up is hard work for baby, you can make it fun and interesting! 

I’d **sit on the floor** with Hayden sitting in front of me. Then, we’d explore objects together, like a ball, teether, or rattle. If he dropped the object, then I’d help him lean over to pick it up. 

Other times, I’d place an object to the side or in front of him and he’d practice picking it up himself. 

**Dangling an object in front of baby** while they’re sitting is another way to grab and explore an object. Plus, it gives baby another perspective of the object.

**Sensory books** are great to use with baby while sitting. I’d open up a page in a book and Hayden would lean forward to touch and explore.

#### **Suggested books**:

## 6. Chef baby

![Produce](/img/img_9252.jpeg)

As fun as it is to explore toys with baby, it’s equally fun to **explore real world objects**. 

Kitchen exploration was one of my favorite things to do with Hayden around this age.

I’d wash some fruits and veggies, such as an apple, carrot, potato, lime, and bell pepper, in advance and put them in a colander. I’d try to select a variety of colors, shapes, and textures. 

At the kitchen table, I’d sit with Hayden on my lap and we’d explore the **colander of produce together** -- talking about and touching each one.

![Kitchen utensils](/img/img_9253.jpeg)

I also did this with kitchen objects. I’d select a few items, like a spoon, whisk, and spatula, in advance and place them on the table. Then, we’d touch, hold, and talk about each one. 

#### **Suggested items**:

Ice cream scoop

Whisk

Spatula

Spoon

Colander

Measuring cups

## 7. Make time for mirror time

![ Baby looking into mirror](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.23.30-pm.png)

Babies love looking at themselves in the mirror! 

Let me share my favorite way to incorporate mirror time. 

**I’d lay side-by-side next to Hayden on his play mat, holding a mirror above us. He loved looking up and studying his face**. Then, I’d turn the mirror to the side so he could see my face -- another face to study! 

I’d point out parts of our faces: “mommy’s nose”; “Hayden’s nose.” This could go on for some time. 

**A mirror is also great to use during tummy time**. Prop a mirror up so baby can study his face while on his belly. He’ll love it!

## 8. Bubble time!

![Bubbles](/img/drew-beamer-hk6e4uxjmgo-unsplash.jpg)

Bubbles are such a thrill for baby!  

Since they’re such a hit, I keep bubbles easily accessible: in the car, stroller, garage, and back porch. I like [Bubble Tree’s bubbles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CMM2YYZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) because they come in a pack of four, are non-toxic, and the bubble solution is in an aluminum bottle.

## 9. Get those hands moving

![Hands](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-9.23.16-pm.png)

Want to get baby some practice using their hands? Give these ideas a try.

**Put a cloth, like a washcloth, on baby’s foot**, and he’ll work hard to pull it off. Once he’s mastered this, you **do the same game with a small oven mitt**: stick the mitt on his foot and baby will pull it off. 

You can **play similar games using baby’s hands**. Put a cloth on baby’s hand, and he’ll pull it off. Then, try a sock or a small oven mitt.

#### **Suggested Items**:

Washcloth

Small oven mit

## 10. Aren’t baby animals cute?!

![Baby animal](/img/adam-mosley-4sepxkg8xzw-unsplash.jpg)

Expose your baby to our beautiful world! 

I purchased a few calendars of artwork, baby animals, and beautiful places:

* [Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2) 
* [National Parks 2022 Box Calendar ](https://www.amazon.com/National-Parks-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549221183/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3LNZYRSIY2HBK&keywords=National+Parks+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978888&sprefix=national+parks+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-3)
* [Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar ](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)

Then, I’d tear off a few pages from a calendar, lay on my back next to Hayden, and we’d look at some beautiful places, animals, and artwork and “talk”about them. 

I’d point out what I saw and ask him questions. Then, I’d pause to see what he had to say.

We’ve been doing this for months and love it! It’s especially fun now that he’s older and babbles responses back to my comments and questions.

## 11. **Fun with books**

This 3 to 4 month age is also when sensory books became a big hit with Hayden. 

I found that sitting on the floor was the best way to engage with these books at this age.

So he’d be in the sitting position, and I’d sit behind him for support. I’d put a sensory book on his legs or on the floor in front of him. Then, he’d lean forward to touch the book.

Outside of sensory books, we did lots of reading while laying on our backs, side-by-side, on his playmat. I found this position more comfortable, and far less to juggle.

## 12. It’s laundry time

![Laundry](/img/annie-spratt-5tfci4nj6b4-unsplash.jpg)

**It seems mundane, but folding laundry can be fun and educational**.

I’d have Hayden “help” me fold a basket of laundry. I’d pull out a towel, for example, and have him touch, hold, and explore it. 

Then, we’d “talk” about it. 

I’d describe the texture and color. I’d also explain when and why we use kitchen towels, for example.

I’d continue the same process with shirts, pants, socks, and anything else that was in the laundry basket.

To break it up, I’d often **incorporate a game of peek-a-boo**. I’d put a small towel over his face or mine, and he’d pull it off. This would result in giggles, lots of giggles.

## 13. Sing and Dance

![Record player](/img/adrian-korte-5gn2soeac40-unsplash.jpg)

**Turn on some beautiful music and listen for a few minutes**. I like to expose my baby to a range of music, and we talk about it. “Do you hear the drums?” Or “I hear a piano and flute.”

We also liked to “dance.” I’d hold Hayden and we’d just sway to the beat. 

**Baby loves the sound of your voice**. He’ll give you lots of smiles as you sing the words to even the most basic of songs. 

These are some of the songs Hayden loved at this age:

* It’s a Small World
* Old McDonald
* The More We Sing Together 
* Mr. Golden Sun

#### **Suggested item:**

## 14. E﻿xplore Nature

![Tree](/img/niko-photos-tgtvxeor_rs-unsplash.jpg)

Make time for nature. **Simply stand in front of a window and look outside, and talk about what you see.** 

On more than one occasion, I’d hold Hayden in front of a window studying a bug attached to the screen from outside. He’d be transfixed. 

Better yet, **step outside and see -- and experience -- nature first hand**. I liked to hold my baby and walk around our backyard, narrating what I saw and heard, as he took in this different environment. 

Point out the sights and sounds you’re experiencing. For example, “I hear the birds chirping.” Or “do you feel the breeze?!” 

You can also introduce elements of nature: pull off a leaf from a tree or pick a flower, show it to him, and have him touch it.

# Activities 5-6 Months

## **1. Parts of the body**

![Learning parts of the body with baby](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-9.49.09-am.png)

Let baby learn about the different parts of his body. 

**Sit or lay next to baby on his playmat, and point out his different facial features**: nose, ears, chin. Say each word as you touch each part. For example, say “this is your left leg” as you touch his left leg. 

**You can also do this activity with a mirror**, so baby can see his nose when you touch it and say the word.

Conclude this “parts of the body” activity with the song **“Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes.”** This always results in many smiles and giggles!

## **2.** Ball pick up

![Baby picking up ball](/img/img_9487.jpeg)

It’s so simple, but so beneficial and fun for baby!

Sit on the floor with baby sitting in front of you. Then, give baby a small ball to hold. A ball without ridges or textures, like a wooden or rubber ball, will give baby a good challenge.

Inevitably, baby will drop the ball. At this point, encourage him to pick it back up. Or he may do this on his own.

It’s hard to do because a ball rolls, and can be hard to grasp. But this gives baby great practice in building hand-eye coordination. 

At the same time, he builds all of the muscles that are involved in the sitting position. 

Eventually, baby will get pretty good at this and may (intentionally or not) roll the ball too far, and it’ll be out of reach.

That’s okay! 

In fact, it’s great because now baby has to figure out how to get out of the sitting position to get the ball. You may need to help him to make this transition initially. But it’ll get easier, and more intuitive for baby, over time.

## **3.** Catch

![Rolling ball on table](/img/fbf46f70-3c1f-44ab-8025-a46cc8435a9a.jpeg)

It’s not too early to start playing catch -- well a modified version, at least, for baby. I got this idea from Dr. Peter Vishton’s online course, Scientific Secrets for Raising Kids Who Thrive, and it’s a good one.

Here’s how it works. **Sit at a table**, like your kitchen or dining room table, with baby on your lap. 

![Rolling ball on table with baby extending arms](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-10.01.50-am.png)

**Use a wood or rubber ball and roll the ball to baby**. 

![Baby catches ball ](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-10.03.32-am.png)

**The aim is for baby to extend one or both hands to “catch” the rolling ball**. 

You can roll the ball straight in front of baby. I found this to be the easiest for Hayden. That way he could extend both arms and catch the rolling ball. 

You can also roll it from the side. Or roll it directly toward one hand in attempt for baby to extend that hand to reach for it.

This game may be hard for baby at first. But soon enough he’ll love it! Plus it’s great for developing hand-eye coordination.

## **4.** Reading is fun!

![Reading with baby](/img/img_9524.jpeg)

This is such a fun age to read with baby!

Hayden loved turning the pages of the board books we read together. He still does!

I’ll say “can you please help me turn the page?” He’ll extend his arm, grab the page with his hand, and push it over. I had to prompt him initially, but now he does it on his own. He loves being involved in the process!

**Lift-the-flap books**, like Dear Zoo, became popular with Hayden around six months. And, of course, **sensorial books continued to be a hit.**

#### **Suggested books**:

## **5.** Hide and seek

![Hide and seek with measuring cups](/img/img_9264.jpeg)

The simplest of games can make for endless entertainment for baby. Hide and seek is one of them. 

Take a few washcloths (ideally they’re cloths of different colors) and **hide three or four balls, one under each cloth**. Station them out of reach for baby to encourage him to move (or slither) to them. He’ll delight in pulling off the cloths and finding the wooden balls. 

You can also **use measuring cups to hide the wooden balls**. Hayden loved this!  

#### **Suggested Items**:

[Wooden balls](https://woodpeckerscrafts.com/wooden-balls/) by Woodpeckers

Washcloths

Measuring cups

## **6.** Fun with measuring cups

![Measuring cups](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-10.13.59-am.png)

Who knew measuring cups could be so much fun for baby?! 

Well, they certainly were for Hayden! We used them in different ways. 

One of his favorites was to simply **pull out each cup when they’re stacked inside each other**. 

![Measuring cups stacked up](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-10.14.56-am.png)

He loved to knock them over when I’d **stack them up like a tower**. 

![](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-10.15.49-am.png)

It’s also fun to **put a ball in each cup**, and have him pull the ball out of the cup. 

Sometimes, he’d use the handle to dump the ball, causing it to roll. Then, he’d want to chase after it!

![Hide and seek with measuring cups](/img/img_9264.jpeg)

And, of course, there’s **“hide and seek.”** Hide a ball under each cup and have baby find them.

#### **Suggested Items**:

## **7.** Get baby moving with mobiles

![Baby moving with mobile](/img/img_9307.jpeg)

By now baby loves being on his tummy. The question is: how can you get baby to realize he can move while on his tummy?

**Use the mobiles from baby’s newborn days**!

Once baby is on his tummy, dangle a mobile in front of him. Then, slowly move (with the mobile in hand) to one side. Baby will follow by rotating on their tummy. Keep moving and baby will keep following the mobile. 

Before you know it, baby has made a complete rotation on his tummy!

## **8.** Splish splash water time fun!

![Water activity](/img/img_7258.jpeg)

**Put some water in a small bin and add a few toys and objects**. 

Hayden was still a bit wobbly at this age, so he sat on the floor and I sat behind him. The bin of water was in front of him so he could explore.

Stacking cups or measuring cups are a fun choice for this activity. 

![Pouring water](/img/img_7250.jpeg)

With your help, baby can scoop up some water and pour it out -- hearing (and sometimes feeling!) the splash this makes. 

Baby will love touching the water. Once baby learns he can splash, you’ll likely find that water goes everywhere. So I found it useful to lay a towel on the floor before starting this activity.

He’ll also like seeing how familiar objects move differently in water. 

**Here’s a fun variant to try: put some water with a few toys and objects on a cookie sheet.** Once again, baby will love to touch and splash in the water. 

And he’ll delight in watching and moving toys across the cookie sheet.

#### **Suggested Items**:

Cookie sheet

Small plastic bin

Measuring cups

## **9.** Sit, reach, crawl  

![Baby sitting ](/img/img_9491.jpeg)

Hayden was content in the sitting position. But then came the day when a ball he was playing with rolled a bit too far from his reach. 

He just sat there, looking at it. I could see him thinking: “what do I do now?!”

Thus began a game that we liked to play, which helped him learn how to get out of the sitting position, so he could retrieve the toy.

Begin with baby in a sitting position and station a desired toy out of reach. Or give baby a toy, like a ball, and wait for him to drop it. A ball is ideal because it’ll roll once dropped.

![Baby leaning forward from sitting position](/img/img_9492.jpeg)

Baby will lean forward and try to reach for the toy. 

![Baby getting into crawling position](/img/img_9497.jpeg)

Help him transition out of the sitting position and into the crawling one. 

![Baby getting the ball](/img/img_9499.jpeg)

Then, once baby is safely on the floor, let him go at it and get his reward -- the toy.

The best learning takes place when you *want* to learn something. If there’s a desired toy, baby will do what it takes to get it, while also learning a new skill along the way.

## **10.** Mirror, mirror on the wall

![Baby looking in mirror](/img/img_9271.jpeg)

The fascination with mirrors only enhances at this age!

**Not only does baby love looking at himself in the mirror. But it’s also a great way to encourage baby to move**.

I’d prop up a mirror on the wall. Hayden would see it and slither quickly as possible toward it. 

After he spent some time studying his face, I’d move the mirror again. And he’d slither to it for yet another opportunity to study his face. 

He was all smiles, as he watched himself slithering up toward the mirror. 

#### **Suggested item**:

Mirror

## **11.** Knock down the tower

![Knocking down blocks](/img/img_9298.jpeg)

A small set of blocks makes for endless fascination for baby. 

**He’ll love to pick up the blocks and clap them together with his hands**. 

Equally fun is to **build a small tower of blocks**. Then, baby will come charging over to knock them down. Stack the tower back up, and he’ll gladly knock them back down.

I used this activity to help encourage Hayden to move, when he was in the beginning stages of crawling. I’d make a tower a foot or two away from him. He’d make his way to it, and knock it down. 

Then, I’d make another tower, and he’d knock it down. And so it continued for some time. 

You can also make a few towers around the room and have baby go from tower to tower, knocking each one over. 

Needless to say, we both got our exercise!

## **12.** It’s time for a trip!

![Travel items](/img/annie-spratt-qyaka7w5umy-unsplash.jpg)

Traveling with a baby or infant is no easy feat. But it’s so worth it. **To see the world through a young person’s eyes is nothing short of amazing**. 

Now is a great time to pack up and head out. 

But you don’t need to travel far. Nor do you have to do anything elaborate. 

The first trip my family of three took was 40 minutes away and we only stayed one night (though by the amount of stuff in our car it looked like we were going to be gone for a month!).

But this little trip served its many purposes. 

First, it exposed our son to a new environment and landscape. A house in the middle of the woods offered many new things to look at and explore. Second, it gave him practice traveling. Above all, it provided family bonding time.

Have a checklist that contains all of the things you need to bring for baby. It'll give you all the peace of mind you need when you’re frantically trying to make it out the door. 

#### **Suggested Item**s:

To warm Hayden up to the idea of traveling, I purchased a few travel-related books for him in advance of the trip and read them to him. Here are a few of my favorites:

## **13.** Water art

![Water art](/img/img_9276.jpeg)

Water art is simple but a lot of fun!

Fill a small paper or plastic bowl with water. 

Put baby in his high chair, or sit with baby on the floor. Help him dip his fingers into the water. 

Then, let him touch or grab the paper. 

It’s fun to make hand prints, too. You can also use [large art brushes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M5GF3DZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to make water marks.

## **14. F﻿inger painting (with taste safe paint)**

![Finger painting](/img/img_9233.jpeg)

I like [this simple recipe](https://rainydaymum.co.uk/baby-play-finger-painting/) to make **homemade finger paint (that's taste safe)**, though I opted for [plant-based food coloring](https://www.amazon.com/365-Everyday-Value-Food-Coloring/dp/B07G2Z6CLG/ref=sr_1_5?crid=29JX5XNW7TPH7&keywords=whole+foods+natural+food+coloring&qid=1663079648&sprefix=whole+foods+natural+food+coloring%2Caps%2C110&sr=8-5).

Have plenty of paper on the table and the paint in a paper bowl. Place baby in his high chair and let him go at it! 

B﻿aby can dip his fingers or hands into the paint. Or you can introduce a [paint brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M5GF3DZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). 

As fun as it is for baby to decorate the paper with paint, it’s equally enjoyable for him to squish the paint in his hands. It’s definitely a sensorial experience!

**You can also put some paint into a Ziplock bag and have baby squish the paint that’s in the bag**. It’s another sensorial experience!

To keep things relatively clean, put baby in a [mess-proof bib](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N4T7KRD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Place the paper with paint into the [Ziplock freezer bag](https://www.amazon.com/Ziploc-Freezer-Bags-Gallon-Count/dp/B00CQAHOCO/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=ziploc+freezer+bags&qid=1663080421&sr=8-5) and close the bag. You can use tape to secure the bag to the table, if you wish.

Now baby can run their fingers over the drops of paint and squish the paint drops with their hands -- without any mess!

## **16.** Sensory boxes: touch, feel, pull

![Bathroom sensory box](/img/img_9263.jpeg)

Help baby develop his senses by creating sensory boxes, using everyday items from home. 

It’s fun to create themed sensory boxes. **Just take a small box or basket and fill it with a handful or so of times**. 

Here are some sensory box ideas to consider:

* **Kitchen box**, which can include an oven mit, spoon (for eating), wooden spoon,  spatula, whisk, and placemat.
* **Bathroom box**, which can include a roll of toilet paper, toothbrush, floss container, loofa, and a box of tissues.
* **Soft-items box**, which can include a loofa, pair of socks, wash cloth, and towel.
* **Ball box**, which contains toy balls of different colors, shapes, and textures.
* **Toy box**, which contains toys and teethers of various colors, shapes, and textures.

Then have baby sit up and pull out each object from the box. 

Babies love to empty a box full of things. They’ll have as much fun pulling everything out as they will touching and exploring each object.

## **17.** Spice it up!

Want a great way to introduce baby into the world of food and enliven their sense of smell?!

**Then, grab some spices and herbs and explore them with baby**.

Hayden loved this activity! Here’s how it works. 

![Smelling spices](/img/45e7e68d-e72b-4d4d-bf35-fb7fc7d17805.jpeg)

I sat in a chair next to him, who sat in a high chair, at the kitchen table. I opened up one spice at a time, and smelled it. Then let Hayden smell it. 

I did the same thing with herbs. I talked about the spice or herb, what it smelled like and what dishes we used it in.  

Fresh herbs, like basil, parsley, rosemary, garlic, thyme, and oregano, work great for this activity. So do spices like cinnamon, garlic powder, cumin, and nutmeg. 

## **18.** Get to know your fruits and veggies!

![Produce](/img/img_9252.jpeg)

Want a great way to introduce fruits and veggies to baby -- and enliven their senses in the process?

Here’s what you can do. Take a colander and wash a few fruits and vegetables, such as an apple, orange, carrot, cucumber, and bell pepper. 

Then, head to the table and explore these items with baby. Pull out an apple, and have baby touch it. Talk about what your baby is seeing a feeling. 

Take this sensory activity a step further by slicing and orange, lemon, or lime and have baby smell and touch it.

A﻿ variety of fruits and veggies

## **19.** A budding chef

**Now is a great time to involve baby in the kitchen**. 

In fact, Hayden has “helped” me make several of his purees. We made a banana puree together, for example. And it was a lot of fun. 

He sat in his high chair and I sat next to him at the kitchen table. I showed him the pile of bananas, as I peeled each one. Then, I let him smell and hold one of the peeled bananas. 

He watched enthusiastically as I sliced the bananas and placed them in the food processor. Once it was smooth, I gave him a small taste. 

This simple activity was a multi-sensorial experience.

**You can even involve baby in some basic recipes**. Hayden has “helped” me make pumpkin bread and spice cake. 

After I fill a measuring cup with flour, he’ll grab the cup handle and together we’ll dump it into the mixing bowl. Later, we’ll both hold the spatula and mix the ingredients together. 

Although he’s not eating these things yet, I still involve him in the process -- and he loves it! 

## **20.** Songs babies will love!

Babies love to hear you sing, even if you’re out of tune like me. 

Hayden loved songs with hand motions at this age. Here are a few of songs to try:

* The Wheels on the Bus
* Where is Thumbkin?
* The Itsy Bitsy Spider
* 5 Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed
* 5 Little Ducks
* If You’re Happy and You Know It

Songs like these are bound to elicit lots of smiles and giggles!
