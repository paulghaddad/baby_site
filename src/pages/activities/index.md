# Activities 0-12 Weeks

## 1. Artist baby

![Abstract art](/img/pexels-steve-johnson-1269968.jpg)

I began sharing my passion for art with Hayden very early on. I purchased the Art Page-A-Day Gallery calendar. 

Then, I tore off a few pages from a calendar. **We’d lay side-by-side on our backs on his playmat to look at beautiful artwork and “talk”about them.**

I’d point out and describe what I saw; I’d also ask him questions, always pausing for him to respond back with a coo, grunt, or even a smile.

This was such a hit!

**So I did the same thing with baby animals and beautiful places**. I purchased a baby animal and national park calendars. 

This activity is especially fun now that he’s older and much more talkative; he loves to babble in response to my comments and questions.

## 2. Customize your play gym

![Play gym with black and white cards ](/img/image_2.jpg)

Early on, Hayden wasn’t engaging with some of the items that came with his play gym.

S﻿o I customized it myself with three black and white cards.

I punched a hole in each one and attached it to the play gym structure with a string. The cards dangled from the top of the play gym. There are images on both sides of the cards, which made them fun to look at -- especially when they moved.

![Play gym with objects ](/img/img_8749.jpeg)

This worked great until he was ready to grasp objects. 

So I customized it again. 

I took objects -- rattles and teethers -- and attached them to the play gym with [red ribbon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091GNB79S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). He loved the challenge of grabbing objects overhead or kicking them with his feet. I made the objects low enough so he could engage his hands and feet.

## 3. The many uses of mobiles

![baby looking at mobile](/img/image_3.jpg)

Babies love mobiles! And so should you -- because you can use them in many different ways.

**I strategically placed a mobile over Hayden’s changing table**. This made diaper changes hassle free. He was mesmerized by the swirls above him -- especially when they moved.

![mobiles](/img/2fe15ecd-f4a1-4349-b320-c19aac68baf4.jpeg)

**I used mobiles above Hayden’s play quilt**, where he’d stretch his arms and legs watching and reacting to the shapes floating above him.

These mobiles were a gift that kept on giving because I used them in different ways as my baby got older and more advanced.

In addition to using these mobiles overhead, **I also used them during tummy time**. This gave Hayden a different perspective. Because mobiles are so fun to look at, they motivated him to lift that heavy head! 

Then, as he began to become more mobile on his tummy, I used the mobiles to encourage Hayden to rotate. I’d hold a mobile in front of him, then slowly move around his playmat and he’d follow me.

## 4. Rattle, rattle, rattle

![Baby holding rattle](/img/img_8629.jpeg)

A rattle is a basic toy that can serve many purposes. **Use it to get your baby accustomed to different textures and sounds**. That’s why I found it useful to have several rattles. 

Rattles also got my baby accustomed to opening and closing his hands to grasp objects.

![baby holding rattle](/img/image_5.jpg)

Here’s what I mean. You hold one end of the rattle and place the other end toward your baby’s hand. The idea is to have your baby grasp the other end of the rattle. 

He may need some prodding. So gently tap his fingers with the opposite end of the rattle. If this doesn’t work, then take his fingers and place them around the opposite end of the rattle to show him how to grasp. 

Once baby has grasped the rattle, then you grab the other end and shake the rattle with him so he can hear the sounds it makes. 

**You can also use a rattle for visual tracking**. Have your baby engage with the rattle, then move it side to side. 

Another way to use a rattle is to shake it and **see if your baby turns their head in response to the noise**.

## 5. Let’s talk

![Talking to baby](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-10.24.51-am.png)

Talk with your baby as much as possible! 

What should you talk about? Anything and everything!

Tell him about your day, what you’re having for dinner, what it was like during your childhood, a trip you’ve taken or want to take. 

You can also talk as you do things with your baby, like dressing him. For example, “I’m putting the blue sock on your right foot.” 

Make eye contact with your baby and have a conversation. Ask him a question, then pause and wait for an answer. Give him time to coo, grunt, or make other noises in return. 

## 6. Make time for book time 

![Reading books](/img/740a5bee-fcae-4675-865c-9d10fe76ac63.jpeg)

It’s never too early to start reading. I began reading to Hayden as soon as we got home from the hospital, and we haven’t stopped!

Early on, I read while holding him.

But I soon found it more comfortable to lay on our backs, side-by-side on his playmat, where I’d hold the book above his head. I found this position to be easier and more comfortable. There was less to juggle!

#### **Suggested books:**

Panda Bear, Panda Bear What Do You See? by Bill Martin Jr.

Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? by Bill Martin Jr.

I Love You to the Moon and Back by Amelia Hepworth

## 7. Let the music play

Turn on some beautiful music and listen for a few minutes. 

I like to expose my baby to a range of music, and we talk about it. “Do you hear the drums?” Or “I hear a piano and flute.” 

You can also sing to your baby -- and you should! Don’t worry about having a bad voice or sounding out of tune, like I do. 

Just sing and maybe even sway back and forth to the tune. Or simply singing “lalalala” repeatedly is fun for your baby. 

#### **Suggested item:**

## 8. Study faces

Make time for your baby to study -- faces that is. 

My baby loves to study faces. It’s a fascination that began early on and continues to this day.

We’d lay on his playmat and explore each others’ face. Sometimes I let him explore my face: I’d take his hand and touch my face and point out different facial features. “This is mommy’s nose,” I’d say as I’d guide his hand to touch my nose. 

Other times, I’d point out different parts of his face: nose, ears, chin, etc. “This is Hayden’s nose,” I’d say as I’d point to his nose. 

**A mirror is handy to have around for this activity**. That way, it’s a multi-sensorial experience: baby can see where his nose is, and hear and feel you point out each facial feature. 

Besides, babies love to look at themselves in the mirror -- so it’s definitely a worthy purchase.

**Baby can also study faces by looking at pictures of babies**. Books about babies, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), worked great for this activity. 

These books also work great during tummy time. Prop open a book and lay it against a wall, so baby has something interesting to look at while on his tummy.

#### **Suggested Items:**

## 9. The great outdoors

![Tree](/img/niko-photos-tgtvxeor_rs-unsplash.jpg)

**Step out to your backyard or go to a park and explore the great outdoors**!

This may seem mundane to you, but being outside is all new territory for baby! 

I’d hold my baby and walk around our backyard, narrating what I’d see and hear, as my baby took in this different environment. 

**Point out the sights and sounds you’re experiencing**. For example, “I hear the birds chirping.” Or “do you feel the breeze?!” 

You can also **introduce elements of nature:** pull off a leaf from a tree or pick a flower, show it to him, and have him touch it.

## 10. Engage baby with black and white high contrast cards

![black and white cards hanging from play gym](/img/image_2.jpg)

We know that black and white cards matter for babies. But did you realize the many different ways you can engage baby with them?! 

**Hang black and white cards from your play gym**. That’s what I did. My baby wasn’t engaging with the items that came with his play gym at first. So I added my own.

I took three [](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DLR33HG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)black and white cards, punched a hole in each one and attached them to the play gym with a string. The cards dangled from the top of the play gym. There were images on both sides of the cards, which make them fun to look at -- especially when they moved.

Eventually, he learned to bat at the cards and loved making them move!

Other times I attached the cards to the top of the play gym and to the side of it -- taking full use of the play gym structure. This also gets him to move his head in different directions. My baby loved finding the cards everywhere he looked. 

**Visual tracking is another way to use black and white cards**. 

Show a card to your baby and let him engage with it. Then, slowly move the card from one side to the other. The idea is that your baby’s eyes stay glued to the card as they move their head side to side.

![baby laying on his side, looking at black and white cards](/img/image_1.jpg)

**You can also place your baby on their side. Then, prop up a card or two across from them**. 

To keep your baby on their side, you may find it useful to roll up a small towel and put it behind their backside for support. This is a great way for baby to get practice laying on his side.

## 11. Make tummy time fun!

![tummy time](/img/3e2a9333-c40b-495b-a709-23719b48bf3c.jpeg)

One day baby will love being on his tummy. Until that day comes, make tummy time fun and interesting with the ideas below.

While baby is on his tummy on his playmat: 

* **Prop up some black and white cards** against the wall for baby to look at. 
* **Lean a mirror against the wall** so baby can look at himself.  
* **Prop a board book against the wall**, and let baby look at the images. Babies love looking at other babies. So I’d open up books, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), while Hayden was on his tummy.
* **Use a mobile during tummy time**. Hayden loved this! It offered a new perspective and motivated him to lift that heavy head!

I’d also tear a few pages from daily calendars of baby animals ([Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)) or artwork ([Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2)) and line the wall with them. Hayden was mesmerized!

Tummy time can be really hard for baby. 

![tummy time using a pillow](/img/bfa6fbfd-b401-4120-84ab-448ca2f40075.jpeg)

Ease him into it by using a nursing pillow to prop up baby.

You can also have baby lay on your chest as you lay flat on the floor or on a couch. 

Or sit at an incline and rest baby on your chest. I found this way to be very effective early on; it was much easier for my baby to lift that heavy head.

# Activities 3-4 Months

## 1. Breakfast with mommy (or daddy)

![breakfast with mommy](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.00.34-pm.png)

After I fed Hayden in the morning, he’d join me at the kitchen table where I’d have my breakfast. “Breakfast with mommy,” as I later called it, turned into a fun daily ritual with a lot of benefits. 

Hayden would sit in his [BabyBjörn bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Cotton/dp/B00BQYVOKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2NUUQWVU6ML1B&keywords=bjorn+baby+bouncer&qid=1663166078&s=home-garden&sprefix=bajorn+baby+bouncer%2Cgarden%2C85&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTk4xQ1ZZRExQRUw5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzY3NjU2MUg2TzZNVUFBMUxXMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTA3MzE4MVNSMUszTVI1SUNGTyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), which was placed near the kitchen table, as I showed -- **and involved** -- him in the breakfast preparation.

I’d open the bag of frozen blueberries and bring them over to him to let him take a look.  

Then, I’d go over to the kitchen cupboard and pull out a bowl. I’d bring it over to him and let him explore it with me. He loved to touch it, as I’d **talk about the color, texture, and weight**. I’d do the same thing with a spoon, placemat, and napkin, along with any other breakfast items. 

**The process mesmerized him**. 

He’d watch carefully as I’d pour some cereal into a bowl and sprinkle a few berries on top. I’d kneel down to his level so he could see and hear me pour orange juice into my glass.

Once breakfast was made, I’d sit at the table and talk with Hayden as I ate. 

I’d ask him a question and then pause as I’d take a bite and wait for him to respond with a coo, grunt, or squeal. 

This would go on until I finished whatever I was eating. Then, we’d go play. The entire process only took 10 to 15 minutes, but the benefits were many:

* **Explore real world kitchen objects and put them to use in a real way**. A bowl, for example, isn’t just another thing in the world; we can use it to hold food. 
* **Model eating and table manners** -- skills that’ll pay dividends when baby begins eating in the near future.  
* **Teach conversational skills**. Ask a question. Pause, and let baby respond, while you take a bite. 

Above all, “breakfast with mommy” is a way to teach patience. 

At first, Haden would only last a few minutes in his bouncer. He was anxious to get up and play. But over time his patience grew, and so did his intrigue with the entire breakfast process, both preparation and cleanup.

## 2. Grab or kick it 

![play gym](/img/img_8749.jpeg)

**Make grasping objects fun for baby**.

I took some of Hayden's favorite rattles and teethers and hung them from his play gym with [red ribbon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091GNB79S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). That way, they were low enough so he could grab them with his hands and put them in his mouth. 

This setup was also a great way to get him using his feet. 

The objects were low enough for him to kick, which he loved to do! I liked the [Baby Bear Wooden Rattle Shaker](https://www.bellalunatoys.com/collections/waldorf-baby-toys-0-12-months/products/green-tones-baby-bear-shaker) for this reason. It was a wide enough target for baby.

**Also consider handing baby an object to explore while he sits in a [baby bouncer](https://www.amazon.com/BABYBJORN-Bouncer-Balance-Soft-Cotton/dp/B00BQYVOKY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2NUUQWVU6ML1B&keywords=bjorn+baby+bouncer&qid=1663166078&s=home-garden&sprefix=bajorn+baby+bouncer%2Cgarden%2C85&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTk4xQ1ZZRExQRUw5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzY3NjU2MUg2TzZNVUFBMUxXMCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTA3MzE4MVNSMUszTVI1SUNGTyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)**. This gives him a different angle to grab objects.

## 3. The many uses of mobiles

![baby with mobile](/img/img_8755.jpeg)

Mobiles can have new uses during these months. 

Sure, you can **hang a mobile overhead** for baby. But that’s just the start. 

**Get baby kicking** by laying baby on their back on their playmat. Then, dangle a mobile just above their feet.  

You can also **use a mobile during tummy time**. 

Get baby on his tummy, then dangle the mobile in front of him or to the side. Hayden loved this! It gave him a new perspective, as well as the motivation he needed to lift that heavy head.

#### Suggested Item:

## 4. **More tummy time fun!**

![Tummy time](/img/img_8850.jpeg)

Use props to make tummy time fun!

**Babies love looking at other babies**. That’s why I’d open up a board book about baby faces, like [Baby Faces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1645586308/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Global Babies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580891748/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and propped it up in front of Hayden. He loved this! I’d turn the pages periodically to keep things interesting.

![Tummy time with mirror](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.23.30-pm.png)

**Mirrors are also a lot of fun for babies**. They love to look at themselves! So place baby on his tummy and prop up a mirror in front of him. 

I also found it useful to **prop up pictures of artwork or baby animals** for him to look at during tummy time. I got these pictures from daily calendars ([Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2) and [Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)). I’d select a few pictures and place them in front of him, which he absolutely loved.

**Mobiles were another favorite** tummy time item. 

Get baby on his belly, then dangle the mobile in front of baby or to the side. Babies love mobiles, and provide the motivation to lift that heavy head!

![Tummy time with toys](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-8.59.15-pm.png)

And you can **always put an enticing toy in front of baby** while he’s on his tummy.

## 5. Sit up and explore

![Baby sitting up looking at toys](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-8.56.36-pm.png)

Although sitting up is hard work for baby, you can make it fun and interesting! 

I’d **sit on the floor** with Hayden sitting in front of me. Then, we’d explore objects together, like a ball, teether, or rattle. If he dropped the object, then I’d help him lean over to pick it up. 

Other times, I’d place an object to the side or in front of him and he’d practice picking it up himself. 

**Dangling an object in front of baby** while they’re sitting is another way to grab and explore an object. Plus, it gives baby another perspective of the object.

**Sensory books** are great to use with baby while sitting. I’d open up a page in a book and Hayden would lean forward to touch and explore.

#### **Suggested books**:

## 6. Chef baby

![Produce](/img/img_9252.jpeg)

As fun as it is to explore toys with baby, it’s equally fun to **explore real world objects**. 

Kitchen exploration was one of my favorite things to do with Hayden around this age.

I’d wash some fruits and veggies, such as an apple, carrot, potato, lime, and bell pepper, in advance and put them in a colander. I’d try to select a variety of colors, shapes, and textures. 

At the kitchen table, I’d sit with Hayden on my lap and we’d explore the **colander of produce together** -- talking about and touching each one.

![Kitchen utensils](/img/img_9253.jpeg)

I also did this with kitchen objects. I’d select a few items, like a spoon, whisk, and spatula, in advance and place them on the table. Then, we’d touch, hold, and talk about each one. 

#### **Suggested items**:

Ice cream scoop

Whisk

Spatula

Spoon

Colander

Measuring cups

## 7. Make time for mirror time

![ Baby looking into mirror](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-7.23.30-pm.png)

Babies love looking at themselves in the mirror! 

Let me share my favorite way to incorporate mirror time. 

**I’d lay side-by-side next to Hayden on his play mat, holding a mirror above us. He loved looking up and studying his face**. Then, I’d turn the mirror to the side so he could see my face -- another face to study! 

I’d point out parts of our faces: “mommy’s nose”; “Hayden’s nose.” This could go on for some time. 

**A mirror is also great to use during tummy time**. Prop a mirror up so baby can study his face while on his belly. He’ll love it!

## 8. Bubble time!

![Bubbles](/img/drew-beamer-hk6e4uxjmgo-unsplash.jpg)

Bubbles are such a thrill for baby!  

Since they’re such a hit, I keep bubbles easily accessible: in the car, stroller, garage, and back porch. I like [Bubble Tree’s bubbles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CMM2YYZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) because they come in a pack of four, are non-toxic, and the bubble solution is in an aluminum bottle.

## 9. Get those hands moving

![Hands](/img/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-9.23.16-pm.png)

Want to get baby some practice using their hands? Give these ideas a try.

**Put a cloth, like a washcloth, on baby’s foot**, and he’ll work hard to pull it off. Once he’s mastered this, you **do the same game with a small oven mitt**: stick the mitt on his foot and baby will pull it off. 

You can **play similar games using baby’s hands**. Put a cloth on baby’s hand, and he’ll pull it off. Then, try a sock or a small oven mitt.

#### **Suggested Items**:

Washcloth

Small oven mit

## 10. Aren’t baby animals cute?!

![Baby animal](/img/adam-mosley-4sepxkg8xzw-unsplash.jpg)

Expose your baby to our beautiful world! 

I purchased a few calendars of artwork, baby animals, and beautiful places:

* [Art Page-A-Day Gallery Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Page-Day-Gallery-Calendar-2022/dp/1523512237/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Art+Page-A-Day+Gallery+Calendar&qid=1662978798&sr=8-2) 
* [National Parks 2022 Box Calendar ](https://www.amazon.com/National-Parks-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549221183/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3LNZYRSIY2HBK&keywords=National+Parks+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978888&sprefix=national+parks+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-3)
* [Baby Animals 2022 Box Calendar ](https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Animals-Calendar-Daily-Desktop/dp/1549220322/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M5S4L6YI09X3&keywords=Baby+Animals+2022+Box+Calendar&qid=1662978858&sprefix=baby+animals+2022+box+calendar+%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-1)

Then, I’d tear off a few pages from a calendar, lay on my back next to Hayden, and we’d look at some beautiful places, animals, and artwork and “talk”about them. 

I’d point out what I saw and ask him questions. Then, I’d pause to see what he had to say.

We’ve been doing this for months and love it! It’s especially fun now that he’s older and babbles responses back to my comments and questions.

## 11. **Fun with books**

This 3 to 4 month age is also when sensory books became a big hit with Hayden. 

I found that sitting on the floor was the best way to engage with these books at this age.

So he’d be in the sitting position, and I’d sit behind him for support. I’d put a sensory book on his legs or on the floor in front of him. Then, he’d lean forward to touch the book.

Outside of sensory books, we did lots of reading while laying on our backs, side-by-side, on his playmat. I found this position more comfortable, and far less to juggle.

#### **Suggested books**:

## 12. It’s laundry time

![Laundry](/img/annie-spratt-5tfci4nj6b4-unsplash.jpg)

**It seems mundane, but folding laundry can be fun and educational**.

I’d have Hayden “help” me fold a basket of laundry. I’d pull out a towel, for example, and have him touch, hold, and explore it. 

Then, we’d “talk” about it. 

I’d describe the texture and color. I’d also explain when and why we use kitchen towels, for example.

I’d continue the same process with shirts, pants, socks, and anything else that was in the laundry basket.

To break it up, I’d often **incorporate a game of peek-a-boo**. I’d put a small towel over his face or mine, and he’d pull it off. This would result in giggles, lots of giggles.

## 13. Sing and Dance

![Record player](/img/adrian-korte-5gn2soeac40-unsplash.jpg)

**Turn on some beautiful music and listen for a few minutes**. I like to expose my baby to a range of music, and we talk about it. “Do you hear the drums?” Or “I hear a piano and flute.”

We also liked to “dance.” I’d hold Hayden and we’d just sway to the beat. 

**Baby loves the sound of your voice**. He’ll give you lots of smiles as you sing the words to even the most basic of songs. 

These are some of the songs Hayden loved at this age:

* It’s a Small World
* Old McDonald
* The More We Sing Together 
* Mr. Golden Sun

## 14. E﻿xplore Nature

![Tree](/img/niko-photos-tgtvxeor_rs-unsplash.jpg)

Make time for nature. **Simply stand in front of a window and look outside, and talk about what you see.** 

On more than one occasion, I’d hold Hayden in front of a window studying a bug attached to the screen from outside. He’d be transfixed. 

Better yet, **step outside and see -- and experience -- nature first hand**. I liked to hold my baby and walk around our backyard, narrating what I saw and heard, as he took in this different environment. 

Point out the sights and sounds you’re experiencing. For example, “I hear the birds chirping.” Or “do you feel the breeze?!” 

You can also introduce elements of nature: pull off a leaf from a tree or pick a flower, show it to him, and have him touch it.
